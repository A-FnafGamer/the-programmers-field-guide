# Activities

For now, you want to start thinking more deeply about how the programs you have used are likely to be working and start to think about the kinds of things you may be interested in building in the future.

- Pick a program that you are familiar with, and describe the digital reality that is presented within that software. What *things* do you imagine exist within that software?
- What would you like to build? Describe a program you would like to create, and then think about the things that you picture as existing within it.

# Wrap Up

This book is about learning to program - learning to create digital realities that can exist and operate within a computer. We will use C-style syntax, while also pointing out other languages you can explore at a later stage.

Before we get into this, we need to explore how to use your computer like a computing professional.
