# Putting Together Digital Realities

This chapter will be a little different from those that follows. For now, we are looking at the landscape around us. You need to start to get a feel for the journey ahead and what will be important.

*So what do you need to take away from this?*

There are two key take aways from this chapter - **abstraction** and **digital realities**.

Computers are hugely complicated, if you try to deal with everything that is going on. In order to get on top of this we must use abstraction. We use abstraction to lift our thinking above the physical reality and events that are occurring within the computer. This allows us to start to build digital realities, within which we can control every aspect of how they work. These realities can interact with the real work. We just have to imaging them, and craft the programming instructions to make them come to life.

So, at this stage, you donâ€™t need to worry too much about how transistors work to create gates within the computer. Nor do you have to worry about how they are designed to make computations function. You can live above these details - because of abstraction. 

At the start of this journey, in Part 1, you will start to explore Programs as Instructions. This will look at the different elements you can put within your source code to control the computer. This will look a little at how these instruction work, looking at the things the compiler will get the computer to do when you use these instructions. This will ensure that you can use these instructions effectively, and understand what you are getting the computer to do when you use these codes.

Your ability to work and engage with abstractions is important now. Programs are abstract - they are our ideas and thought manifested in code. You need to be able to hold these imaginary entities within your mind so that you can engage with constructing the code that will make them come to life.
