# Digital Realities Overview

To get started on your journey, letâ€™s start by thinking about what programs are and how computers work. This will help set the scene, providing you with the broad context and perspective on computing. Much of what is in this part will be the backdrop for our future explorations, as we delve into details and mechanics of how programs work.

The sights of this chapter will explore the [concepts](./abstraction/concepts) that underpin computing. This will introduce the following:

- **Programs** - we will look at how programs drive the computer and empower us to achieve more.
- **Digital Realities** - exploring how to *think* about program as and software, and how these create a reality within he computer.
- **Abstraction** - will examine the way we use abstraction within computing to help us make sense of what is going on within the computer.
- **Code** - explores the different kinds of computer code that we use to get the computer to do things.



By the end of this chapter you will be able to:

- Describe how programs are like digital realities, and reflect on the opportunities this creates.
- Describe the main parts of the field guide and the emphasis of each part.
- Describe how the process of abstraction enables the creation of digital realities within computing devices.
