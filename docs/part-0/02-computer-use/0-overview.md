# Overview

For many people, using a computer involves touching and swiping icons on their smart phone or tablet, or using a mouse and keyboard to interact with buttons and controls on windows drawn to the monitors attached to their display. These elegant digital realities provide a convenient way to enable us to launch and use programs on our computers.

This wasnâ€™t always the way that we interacted with computers, and these programs require significant effort to build these interfaces. As a result, there are many tools that developers and computing professionals use that do not have graphical interfaces. Instead, these tools have simple command line interfaces where you interact with it by typing commands and responding to prompts at a terminal.

The fact these programs have simple text driven interfaces can be a challengage at the start, but this makes these programs much easier to automate and you can combine them in interesting ways to quickly and easily achieve a range of useful tasks.

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:

- Access and interact with your computer via a terminal.
- Use command line programs to perform a range of computing tasks.
- Explain the operating environment of programs, the means of sending input to a program, and interacting with the output fron a program.
- Use pipes and redirection to move data between programs, and to files.
