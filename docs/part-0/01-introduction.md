# 1. Introduction

## Welcome to the Programmer's Field Guide

This book will equip you with the skills you need to understand and build software and engage with the growing capabilities that computing offers. We want you to come out of this with a good understanding of how programs work, with tools to help you create your programs, and the skills necessary to keep learning programming languages, libraries, and tools as you grow in the field.

This first chapter will explain how we will be approaching the task of introducing you to these concepts and tools. It will give you an overview of computer systems and a big picture of how to computing works. The chapter will outline how the parts in the book are organised and how the knowledge and skills you develop will build over these.

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:

- Describe how programs are like digital realities, and reflect on the opportunities this creates.
- Describe the main parts of the field guide and the emphasis of each part.
- Describe how the process of abstraction enables the creation of digital realities within computing devices.

## Programs, what are they?

Computers are everywhere, helping enhance many aspects of our lives. There are computers embedded within many everyday items, most people carry around a computer in their pocket and possibly another on their wrist, and we interact with software for so many things each day.

*Why are computers everywhere?*

In the video below, Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, describes the computer as a tool that acts like a **bicycle for the mind**. From our perspective, this is trying to capture the role of the computer as a tool to *accelerate our thoughts and imaginations*. This sits at the root of the answer to why computers are so useful and so connected to our daily lives. If we can imagine a digital reality, with some constraints, we can create this reality within code and have it accelerated by computing - which can quickly and reliably undertake the actions we coded within the software.

Programs allow you to instruct the computer to build a reality - a conceptual model that contains the things you need within the program to make it do what you want. In a way, this is a conceptual machine (a bicycle for the mind) with imaginary parts that can perform actions and interact with the real world in the way we want. Accelerating the capability of your mind to a new level, like a bicycle does for human movement.

Within these programs, you build the *things* you need to achieve your objectives, *things* built upon information and instructions to modify that information based on external stimuli. Programs can receive **inputs** from the real world, with buttons, mice and sensors turning real-world actions and values into digital values that can be used. With motors, displays, speakers, and other devices enabling programs to change things within the real world - which we can think of as the **outputs** of the program.

This capability makes computers very useful. If we can imagine a useful digital reality, and create this using programming tools, then this reality will exist within the computers running your program. Your code will get the computer to respond in meaningful ways to inputs, and generate meaningful changes in the real world (outputs).

*Learning to program will give you the skills and tools needed to create digital realities. Giving you the tools to shape harness the bicycle for the mind!*

## Digital Reality

*What do we mean by a digital reality?*

Letâ€™s think about some computer programs you will have interacted with. Take a word processor, for example. Within this, you can create documents, that contain paragraphs, sentences, words, images, and other resources.  None of these things exist within the computer, but we accept this reality. We can input values from the keyboard and use a mouse, touchscreen, or trackpad to interact with parts of the documents. We can see the documents on a screen, and print documents to paper to see them in the real world. This is the digital reality created by word processing software.

We can also think about things like banking. Banks run large financial systems, which operate within each bank's computer systems. We can see our accounts, that contain our money - though there is no money within any computer. We accept this reality and can interact with it by transferring to or accepting funds from, others. These actions change values within these digital realities (programs) - no actual money moves in this process. We can use an ATM to withdraw money - where the computer powers motors within the machine to release actual money in response to changes within the digital reality. This demonstrates how these digital realities exist and empower our day-to-day lives.

Every computer game you have played is also a digital reality. The characters of these games do not exist within the computer, but **they do exist** within the digital reality created by the program's code. These are great examples of purely fictional realities which we can create with computers. The rules of these realities are then things we can create to entertain people.

Hopefully, you can see how powerful this makes computing, and how valuable it can be to understand how these realities can be created. This understanding underpins any study you do in computing, and computing underpins so many things within our lives. Understanding how programs work within the computer, and the things are constructed from, will help you see how to make the most of these tools in whichever field you work.

### Digital Realities and Abstraction

*Before we move on, we need to think a little about how these digital realities come into existence.*

Generally, you will find that programming texts will describe programming in terms of **abstraction**. This comes from thinking about how a computer works and the process of this enables us to create digital realities. To see this, we need to think about what a computer is.

A computer is an electronic device. It operates by controlling voltage through its circuits, with transistors enabling us to detect the presence or absence of voltage at certain places within the computer. So, at this level, a computer is just an electrical current flowing through a circuit.

*So how does this become a digital reality?*

The answer is - through abstraction. Using abstraction, we can *imagine* that the presence of voltage at a certain place becomes a **1** whereas absence would be **0** - giving us a binary value. This gives us a means of representing information. Other parts of the computer use gates that direct current through the circuits to change the values in these transistors - in a controlled way. At this level, a computer is a binary machine capable of manipulating binary values with things like simple mathematical operations being built within the electronics to achieve this effect.

Abstracting this further, we can combine individual binary values into numbers and use these to represent characters, images, sounds, text, and other kinds of data. We can take this further to combine these individual values into entities like bank accounts, characters and levels in games, documents in a word processor, or any other *thing* we want to represent within the digital realities we are creating.

Actions can also be abstracted, building from simple mathematical operations to become actions meaningful to the entities within our reality. We can transfer funds between bank accounts, move players within a game, add pages to documents, and any other action we want or need to perform within the reality we are creating.

By using **abstraction**, we can work at this higher level. Ignoring the details of how this works at the lower levels, at least most of the time. In this way, we spend our time picturing the reality we want to create and crafting the code needed to produce this.

_**This** is what software development is all about._

## How do we get there?

This book focuses on helping you develop a strong mental model of programming. It does not go down to exploring gates and electronics in much detail but focuses on the programming abstractions we can build within the computer. It takes a bottom-up approach to introducing tools and capabilities, ensuring you can understand how these build upon each other as you go. Initially, you will explore how instructions in the computer work at the lower levels, to help you understand what is happening as your programs run. This will ensure you can see how the different parts all start to work together, meaning you can explain how your programs work which in turn will help you know how to get new things working in the future. If you want to explore lower levels, have a look at books on computer systems. These often explore the lower-level aspects of how computers work, the gates and how these can be combined to build a computer. The [From Nand to Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org) book is a great example of this.

We are currently in **Part 0**, which sets the background for the book. In this part, the introduction outlines the approach of the book, with the following chapters on computer use and building programs helping you start to work with the computer through command line instructions and low-level tools.

**Part 1** of the book will focus on *programs as instructions*. This part will help you understand how the most basic of the elements work within these digital realities. You will see how each of these works looking at them in detail to see how they work at the lower levels of abstraction. Understanding how these work will help you see how these core parts work within the programs we create. Programs in this section will be relatively small, enabling you to focus on the mechanics and effect of each instruction. Your learning from this will give you a solid foundation upon which to start building larger programs.

**Part 2** moves up to consider how we can start building larger *things* within our digital realities - taking it to another level of abstraction. This will introduce you to tools to combine things, helping package instructions and data into the kinds of entities that exist within even the most sophisticated digital realities. Programs in this section will start to get a little larger, as you build more meaningful entities. However, we will focus mostly on how the *programs are* a way of *organising* code. What you learn from this will help set you up to start thinking about how these come together.

In **Part 3**, we will move away from code to think more about software design. You will see how you can use the different kinds of packages (from part 2) to build complex realities, with *programs as conceptual models*. Building upon your understanding of how to organise code, and your understanding of how programs work as instructions. With this understanding, you will have the knowledge and skills needed to design and create sophisticated digital realities.

We conclude the book in **Part 4** where we look at how to use the things you have learnt to build a range of real-world software systems. This will give you an initial look at how to use the things you have learnt, with professional tools, to create any kind of software system.

## But what language will I learn?

There is often a fixation on which language you will use when learning to program. Should we pick this language or another, what should inform the choice of language?

This book will focus on building your mental model. The focus is not on a particular language, but on things common across most languages. It will use language features common to many programming languages, helping you build a strong mental model that will be capable of quickly picking up and using many different programming languages. Each chapter will also contain a section that reaches out to other languages, showing you how the concepts covered exist or ar different in other languages. This will help you see that what you are learning is *more* than just *a programming language*.

*So which langauge will you use?*

The book start with C#, transition to C/C++, then come back to C#. This will allow you to focus on a common style of programming syntax, the C-style syntax, while giving you a modern language to work with. More importantly, these languages provide mechanisms to demonstrate the breadth of capabilities you need to explore. However, we are not going to focus on language parcularities, and we will ignore things that are not common elsewhere. This means that you will need to further study these languages after finishing this book to really say you have *leanrt* that language. But the great this is, you will have all of the skills and understanding you need to learn this with the resources available online and through things like generative artificial intelligence.

Most modern systems are built using multiple programming languages - as different languages are better at different things. There is no one best language, so our approach aims to show you the common features across languages and give you set you up to quickly pick up the language that best fits your needs. This is something we draw upon in Part 4, where we will use different programming languages as we build out these different real-world programs.

## Activities

For now, you want to start thinking more deeply about how the programs you have used are likely to be working and start to think about the kinds of things you may be interested in building in the future.

- Pick a program that you are familiar with, and describe the digital reality that is presented within that software. What *things* do you imagine exist within that software?
- What would you like to build? Describe a program you would like to create, and then think about the things that you picture as existing within it.

## Wrap Up

This book is about learning to program - learning to create digital realities that can exist and operate within a computer. We will use C-style syntax, while also pointing out other languages you can explore at a later stage.

Before we get into this, we need to explore how to use your computer like a computing professional.
