    "description": "Welcome to the Programmer's Field Guide. Part 0 is all about getting you started, and helping you see the journey that lies ahead of you. The introduction provides the map of the journey, helping to show you what you are working with and how this guide can help you get there. Computer use gets you started using your computer like a computing professional, getting you started accessing low-level interfaces with your computer, using programs that others have created. Building programs gets you setup with the tools you need to build your own programs."
