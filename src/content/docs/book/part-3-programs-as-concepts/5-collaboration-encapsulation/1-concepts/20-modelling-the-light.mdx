title: Modeling the Light
---

Let's put what we have covered together to design a light simulator and a simple light.

In this video we explore the design of a small light simulator which will allow us to draw and interact with a virtual light bulb. This demonstrates the use of classes to define roles for objects, and how we can use control flow to make these objects interactive.
