title: Code quality, a matter of style

There are many ways to get a program working, so what makes a good program? What helps make the code of one program better than another. 

When you write the code for a program, the way you present the code has a significant impact on how easy the code is for others to understand. It is important to understand how to present your code so that it follows good coding conventions. This will help make your code easy to work with, understand, and debug. 

To get started there are a couple of things that you can work on. These relate to the **indentation** of your code, and the **naming** of the artefacts you create. 

- indent your code with a number of spaces (2 to 4) when coding aspects that are within some other artefact or action.
- methods should be indented within their enclosing class. This helps you see the start and end of the class, as well as seeing that each method is within the class.
- The code within a method should also be indented, so you can see the start and end of the methodâ€™s instructions. 

The indentations make things easier to read and helps you get a visual feel for the structure of the program. Correct indentation will become more important as you start to learn about the different actions you can code within a method. 

Similarly, naming your artefacts is really important and the names should reflect the purpose of the artefact.

- A class name should relate to the role the class plays in the program (it is usually an abstraction of something related to the program).
- Method names should tell you what you get getting the object to do. Method names are usually verbs, while class names are nouns.

The letters you use within the name are important. C# is **case sensitive**, so UPPERCASE and lowercase characters are different.

C# programmers use **PascalCase** for class and method names: the case starts each word with an uppercase character.

Variable names should be in **camelCase**: starts with a lowercase character and each new word starting with an uppercase character. 

Programmers are particular about coding conventions, as small details such as indentation and the characters you use can make a big difference to how easy it is to understand the code.
