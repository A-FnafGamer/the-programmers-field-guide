title: Coding Main
---

To get started writing up your own programs, lets start by seeing how to create a class and define a main method. The details and syntax diagrams for this are all present in the [Syntax Guide](../26-syntax-guide).

Use the following steps to get started building a small program. This will feed into Task 1.2P in [OnTrack](https://ontrack.deakin.edu.au). So mark that task as *Working On It* and lets get started.

#### Making the Project

Step 1 is to make the project, so you have somewhere to code up your instructions.

1. Start by creating a new folder to store your project's code. The following shows the instructions for doing this in the terminal.

```bash
cd /c/Users/andrew/Documents/Code
mkdir WorkingWithObjects
cd WorkingWithObjects
```

2. Get **skm** and **dotnet** to create a new .NET project for you:

```bash
skm dotnet new console
skm dotnet restore
```

3. Open **Visual Studio Code** and open the folder you created. Remember to open the folder, not just the *program.cs* file. This will ensure that the C# extension is activated which will give you extra help as you code.

We are now ready to code the program.

#### Adding in Main

Now we need to create a class and give it a _static_ main method. This is where the program starts running. It is a _static_ method so that it is associated directly with the class, and you don't need an object to run this.

1. Add the following code to your _program.cs_:

```cs
using System;
using SplashKitSDK;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        // instructions go here...
    }
}
```

1. Compile and run the program from the terminal.

```bash
    skm dotnet run
```

Here you have defined a new class called `Program`. It contains the definition for a method named `Main`... which does not have instructions yet, but we will get to that in the next step.

Notice that the `{ ... }` for the class and the method surround the things that they contain. `Main` must be within the Program's block (`{...}`) so that it is part of that class. In C#, the code files can only contain classes and namespaces. Methods can only exist within a class.

Compile and run your program to check that it works. If you get any errors you can use the discussion board to post up questions.
