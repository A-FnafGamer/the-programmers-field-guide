title: Using Objects
---

Now we have an object, we can ask it to do things. Remember **objects know and can do things**. So we have a Window object, it knows and can do _window_ related things. How can we interact with the Window object to get it working for us?

Firstly, we need a way of _remembering_ the object within our code. To do this we create a variable and store a _reference_ to the object within it. Once we have the variable we can use it, though the dot (`.`) operator, to tell the object to perform an action or to respond to a request.

Lets check out the code:

1. Adjust your Main method so that it now draws the house shown above.

```cs
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Window shapesWindow;
    shapesWindow = new Window("Shapes by ...", 800, 600);

    shapesWindow.Clear(Color.White);
    shapesWindow.FillEllipse(Color.BrightGreen, 0, 400, 800, 400);
    shapesWindow.FillRectangle(Color.Gray, 300, 300, 200, 200);
    shapesWindow.FillTriangle(Color.Red, 250, 300, 400, 150, 550, 300);
    shapesWindow.Refresh();

    SplashKit.Delay(5000);
}
```

2. Build and run the program.

```bash
    skm dotnet run
```

    Make sure it all looks correct before moving on.

The `Window shapesWindow;` code declares a variable. It can refer to an object, but when it is declared it starts off being empty (`null` in C#). If you ask it to do something at this stage the program will crash, as the variable does not yet refer to an object.


With `shapesWindow = new Window("Shapes by ...", 800, 600);` we create an object (with `new`) and then store a reference to it in `shapesWindow` (with `=`). You can now use `shapesWindow` to refer to this object you just created.

The remainder of the code uses the doe operator (`.`) to tell the `shapesWindow` object to perform some actions.

Here are some points to remember as you move on:

- `new` is the only way to create an object.
- You can have a number of variables all referring to the same object.
- The dot operator allows you to ask an object to perform one of its methods.

Give this code a go yourself, then try out `MoveTo`. You can tell the `shapesWindow` to `MoveTo` a different location on your screen. If you have VS Code setup correctly you should be able to see a list of things you can tell the window to do. Have a pay around and see what you can get working.
