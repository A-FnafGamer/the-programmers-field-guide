Control flow statements give you the power to add dynamic behaviour to your program's code. See how to add dynamic behaviour to your objects.

So far methods have been able to run a sequence of statements. The challenge with this is that the actions are always the same. Without the ability to change the sequence of actions your programs are very limited in their capabilities. This video will introduce control flow statements and get you started making your methods more dynamic.

Remember to check see this week's [syntax guide](../23-syntax-guide) for details on how to code these new ideas.
