Discover how to create a custom type that represents one of a small set of values.

It is often useful to be able to create a custom type that provides the user with a list of potential values.

For example, in SplashKit we need a way to identify which key you want to know about when you ask if a key is held down. To make it easy for others to use these methods, we created a `KeyCode` enumeration which lists all of the possible values we will accept for a `KeyCode`.

The following code shows the declaration of the `MouseButton` enumeration from SplashKit. When you look at this, you can see all of the values that are valid for a MouseButton variable. You can have a look at this code in the _SplashKit.cs_ file in the lib folder of any of your SplashKit projects.

```cs
public enum MouseButton
{
  NoButton,
  LeftButton,
  MiddleButton,
  RightButton,
  MouseX1Button,
  MouseX2Button
}
```

Once you have created an enumeration, you can use it as a **type** for variables (local, field, and parameters), methods, and properties. So, the following code snippets are all working with `MouseButton` values.

You can declare variables to store `MouseButton` values.
```cs
MouseButton favouriteButton;
```

You can accept parameters and return values that are `MouseButton` values.
```cs
public bool MouseDown(MouseButton button) { ... }
public MouseButton ActiveButton { get; set; }
```

When you want to get a value from an enumeration, you access the value from the enumeration. This looks similar to accessing a static property on a class.

The following code demonstrates use of `MouseButton` values. You can access fixed values like `MouseButton.LeftButton`, or use values stored in variables or returned from methods or properties.

```cs
favouriteButton = MouseButton.LeftButton;

if ( MouseDown(MouseButton.RightButton) ) ...
if ( MouseDown(favouriteButton) ) ...
if ( MouseDown(ActiveButton) ) ...
```

Internally, enumerations are actually stored as an integer value. C# then maps each name from within the enum, to a unique value. By default the first name will have the value 0, the second the value 1, etc. So `MouseButton.NoButton` will have the value 0, `MouseButton.LeftButton` the value 1, and so on.

If you want, you can assign values to the names within the enumeration yourself. For example, we wanted each `KeyCode` to have a certain value, so they are each assigned a value when they are declared. The following code shows a snippet of the declaration of the `KeyCode` enum.

```cs
public enum KeyCode
{
  ...
  Num0Key = 48,
  Num1Key = 49,
  Num2Key = 50,
  AKey = 97,
  BKey = 98,
  CKey = 99,
  DKey = 100,
  EKey = 101,
  ...
}
```

In general, enumerations make your code much more readable, and help make it easy for others to know what is expected where these values are needed.
