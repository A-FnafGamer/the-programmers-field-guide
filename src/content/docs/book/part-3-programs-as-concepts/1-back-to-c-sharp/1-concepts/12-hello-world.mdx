title: Hello World
---

To create “Hello World” we will be using the _Visual Studio Code_ editor. Visual Studio Code uses a project structure to keep track of the files related to a program. This runs from the **Terminal**. We will guide you through using the Terminal and these programs to setup the structure for a program.  

Follow the instructions in the Task PDF sheet you downloaded from OnTrack. This will guide you through the process of writing the code and compiling and running it using .NET Core.
