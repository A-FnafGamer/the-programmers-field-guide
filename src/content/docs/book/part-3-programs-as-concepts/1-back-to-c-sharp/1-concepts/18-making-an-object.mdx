title: Making an Object

# Content

Now that we have main, we can use it to create and get started working with an object.

Objects are made from classes. The class defines a template for the objects it creates - with all of the instance members existing within each of the objects it creates (instance members are those that are not marked as `static`).

[SplashKit](http://splashkit.io) provides a number of classes that can be used to create objects that do interesting things. One such class is the Window. To open the window, create a new Window object. For example  `new Window("House Drawing", 800, 600);` will open a window 800 pixels wide and 600 pixels high with the title "House Drawing".

1. Lets get this started by creating a new Window, and using SplashKit to delay us for a few seconds. Give the following code a try:

```cs
    using SplashKitSDK;

    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            new Window("Window Title... to change", 800, 600);

            SplashKit.Delay(5000);
        }
    }
```

1. Compile and run the program from the terminal.

```bash
    skm dotnet run
```

    You should see the window open, and the program delay for 5 seconds.

2. Change the window title to "Shapes by " and your name. For example, `"Shapes by Andrew"`.

    Switch back to the terminal to compile and run your program.

The `new` keyword is used to create a *new* **object**. This is the only way to create an object in C#. After `new` you place the name of the class you want to create the object from. So `new Window(...)` creates a Window, `new SoundEffect(...)` creates a sound effect, and so on. Where the `...` is a placeholder for the data that the object needs when it is created.

In the above code the `Window` is passed its title, width, and height when it is created. The object remembers these details (in its fields) and acts on those when it is drawn. So this window has the title `"Window Title... to change"` and has a width of 800 pixels, and a height of 600 pixels.

Try changing the size and caption of the window and see how these values relate to what is created. Also try creating a second and third window... what happens?
