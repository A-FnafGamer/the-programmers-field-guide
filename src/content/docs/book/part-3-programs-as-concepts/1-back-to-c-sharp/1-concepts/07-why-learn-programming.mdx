title: Why learn programming?
---

The world is rapidly evolving, and computers will play an ever-increasing role in our lives. Computer Science continues to change and disrupt the world. 

As the power  of computers expands, their potential enables us to continually reinvent how many things function and perform. Learning to program will help you engage with these changes.  

Programming is at the core of Computer Science. Learning to program will help you understand how computers operate, and will better equip you to grasp and envisage potential opportunities by harnessing the power of computers.  

Watch [Computer Science is Changing Everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqSu1IbcHg) by [Code.org](https://code.org) which provides a great summary of the current and growing potential of programming and computer science.
