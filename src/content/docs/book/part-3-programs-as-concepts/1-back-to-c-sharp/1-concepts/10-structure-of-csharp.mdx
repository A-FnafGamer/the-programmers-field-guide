title: Reflecting on your learning

Explore how the .NET libraries are organised to get a better feel for how to approach learning this framework.

The .NET framework organises the classes you use into **namespaces**. These namespaces are organised in a hierarchy, with the `System` namespace being the root of this structure. The following poster image visually shows the organisation of the .NET framework version 3.5 (unfortunately they haven't produced a poster for the newer versions). You can get a readable version of this from the [Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=19341).

Some of the key namespaces include:

Namespace | Details 
---------|----------
`System` | Fundamental classes used across many programs.
`System.Collections` | Collection classes that work with `Object`.
`System.Collections.Generic` | More modern collection classes using generics. 
`System.Data` | Classes for working with data from databases.
`System.Data.Common` | Classes and interfaces for accessing database management systems.
`System.Diagnostics` | Classes to help debug your programs. 
`System.Drawing` | Classes for performing basic drawing and graphics operations.
`System.IO` | Contains classes to work with reading and writing data.
`System.Net` | Gives you classes that make it possible to communicate with others over the network.
`System.Reclections` | Allows you to create objects that relate and manipulate the classes, methods, and interfaces, in your programs.
`System.Security` | Classes and namespaces for things like access control and cryptography.
`System.Text` | Adds additional classes for working with text in your programs.
`System.Web` | Has classes and namespaces that focus on building the web applications.
`System.Windows` | Windows Presentation Foundation classes for making Windows applications.
`System.Windows.Forms` | Used for making Windows forms applications.

### Namespaces and Assemblies

These namespaces are distributed across a number of **assemblies**. An assembly is a compiled unit of code, in either an **exe** or **dll** file. For these framework classes the assemblies will be _dll_ files so that you can refer to them in your own programs. A dll is a **Dynamic-link library**, meaning that the operating system will connect your code to the library code when the program runs.

To use a dll you need to add a reference to the library in your project settings. The new dotnet core handles this with NuGet packages, which you can explore for accessing a wide range of additional functionality.
