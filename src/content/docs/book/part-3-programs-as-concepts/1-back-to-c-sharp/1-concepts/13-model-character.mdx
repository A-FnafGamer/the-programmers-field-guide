title: Making a Space Game
---

Explore how to make use of objects to design a small space game. See how you can use control flow to move the game beyond a simple scripted sequence.

In this video we walk you through the design and code of a small space game that has a space ship that can move around on the screen.

At the start the game runs just a scripted sequence of moves and then ends. See how you can make use of control flow with loops to keep the game running while the user has not closed the window.
