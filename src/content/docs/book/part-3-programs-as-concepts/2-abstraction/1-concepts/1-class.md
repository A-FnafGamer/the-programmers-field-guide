title: Class
---

In C#, **classes** are the tool we use to create our *entities* that contain data and methods.
A class is a [type](../../../../part-2-organised-code/3-structuring-data/1-concepts/03-01-struct), so it acts a *blueprint* we can use to declare variables and create values.

When you create a class, you define what the objects of that class will **know** (data) and what they will be able to **do** (methods).



Classes are powerful, because they allow us to organise our code differently to any other tools we've added to our toolkit so far.
Because they are so different, classes also require us to *think* differently about how we design digital realities.
This can be a big shift, so for now we will focus on what classes are and how they work.
In [Part 3](../../../../part-3-programs-as-concepts/00-part-3-programs-as-concepts) we will explore how to make decisions about using them.
