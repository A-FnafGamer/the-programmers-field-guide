FROM OLD CHAPTER ON CLASSES AND OBJECTS


In [Part 2, Chapter 2](<../../2-organising-code/0-overview/>) we learned how to organise the instructions in our code into named groups called **functions** and **procedures**.
Then, in [Part 2, Chapter 3](<../../3-structuring-data/0-overview/>) we learned how we can use **custom data types** to organise the data in our programs.

In this chapter we will explore the power of **classes**, which are another tool we use to organise our code.
Using classes we can combine functions, procedures, and data into a single entity.
They are a powerful tool, and open up new and exciting capabilities for building digital realities.

## Learning goals

By the end of this chapter you should be able to:

* Describe what a class is, and how classes relate to objects.
* Read UML class diagrams and implement the class structures they describe.
* Write basic UML class diagrams to communicate your own class structures.
* Explain and visualise what the computer does during the runtime of simple programs using classes.
