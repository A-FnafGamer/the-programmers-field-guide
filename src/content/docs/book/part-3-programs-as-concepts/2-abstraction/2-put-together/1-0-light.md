title: Light Simulator
---

Let's put what we have covered together to design a light simulator with a simple light. This program will show a light on the screen and allow the user to toggle the light on and off. This could be the start of a home automation system where the user will have digital versions of their lights which they can switch on and off by interacting with the light in the software.
