title: Expression
---

[Expressions](../../../1-sequence-and-data/1-concepts/04-expression) were covered in the previous chapter. So this is just a quick recap as expressions are a key component of programming language syntax.

Statements need data, and in each case this data can be calculated using different mathematical operations, method calls, variables, and so on. To handle this, all values within statements are coded as **expressions**. This means you have the full range of calculation options in method arguments as you have in assignment statements.

Once you learn how to form an expression, you can use this same knowledge anywhere you code a value in your program.

:::note[Summary]
- An expression is a **term** given to the values you calculate within the statements in your code.
- Expressions are pretty standard across most languages, once you get the hang of these there will be small differences between languages but they are mostly the same.
