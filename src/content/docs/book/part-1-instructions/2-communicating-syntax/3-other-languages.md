There are a number of ways that grammars can be expressed. Generally these are expressed textually, and not directly used to help teach the language - which is a shame as the grammar is the most direct way to learn when you want to pick up new language.

For now it is probable best not to explore too much into language grammars, as these are now genarally written for the compiler creaters rather than their users. Once you feel on top of your first language, then it is probably good to try to pick up another language. This will really help you see how similar things are.
