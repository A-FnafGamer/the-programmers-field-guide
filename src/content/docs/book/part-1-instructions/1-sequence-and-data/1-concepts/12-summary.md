## Summary

This section has introduced several programming building blocks, some programming terminology, and two different instructions. An overview of these concepts is shown in [Figure 5.15](#FigureSummary). The next section will look at how you can use these concepts to design some small programs.

:::note

- Building blocks are things that go into building your digital reality. You can create and use these within your code.
- Instructions capture the different *things* you can command the computer to perform.
- Your program is a **sequence** of instructions that use **data** (in variables, constants, and literals) that get the computer to do something when it is run.
