:::note[Summary]

- A Program is an **Artefact**, you create Programs that the user can execute. Internally these programs contain other artefacts such as Procedures, Functions, and Variables.
- You can declare your own [Functions](#function) within your programâ€™s code.
- With C and Pascal the Function must be declared before it is used.
