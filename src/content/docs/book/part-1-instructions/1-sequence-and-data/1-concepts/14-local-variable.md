## Concept

Variables can be declared at a number of different places in your code. Variables that are declared within Procedures are called **Local Variables**. Most of the variables in your code will be Local Variables.

:::note[Summary]

- Local Variable is the **term** given to a Variable that is declared within a Procedure.
- Variables that are declared within Procedures are called **Local Variables**.
- Local Variables are located within the Procedure they are declared in.
- They can only be accessed by instructions in the Procedure.
- It is **good practice** to use Local Variables to store values. These variables can only be accessed from the instructions **within** the Procedure, this makes it easier to understand how the variable is being used and where it is being changed.
- Space is allocated for the Local Variables when the Procedure is called.
- When the call ends, the Local Variables for that call are destroyed
