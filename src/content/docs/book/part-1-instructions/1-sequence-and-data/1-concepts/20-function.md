## Concept

Functions are used to calculate values. In many ways a Function is just like a Procedure, it has a name, can be called, can accept parameters, can have local variables, and performs a number of instructions when it is called. Unlike a Procedure, however, Functions are used to calculate values. When the function you called ends it returns back to you with a value.
