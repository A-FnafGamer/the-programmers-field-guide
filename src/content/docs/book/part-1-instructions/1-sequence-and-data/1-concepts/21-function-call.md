:::note[Summary]

- A Function Call is an **action**, but one that is performed as part of an Expression.
- Function calls can appear in any expression. For example, you can use a Function Call to calculate the value in an [Assignment Statement](#assignment-statement). You can use a Function Call to calculate the argument values for a procedure call.
