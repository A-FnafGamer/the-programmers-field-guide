## Concept

A library is a collection of reusable code artefacts. Each programming language has its own <span class="review">libraries</span>, and your programs can make use of the code available in <span class="review">these libraries</span>.

[Figure 5.9](#FigureLibrary) shows the concepts related to a library.
