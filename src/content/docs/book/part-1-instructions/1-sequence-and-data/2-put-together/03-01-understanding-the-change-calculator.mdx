## Understanding the Change Calculator

Receiving change from a transaction is something that you should be familiar with, and deter- mining the ideal change is not an overly complex task. While the task itself is common, it does not mean that you can skip thinking about it. If you had to give $6.50 in change you know without thinking that you should give three $2 coins, and one 50c coin. What you need to do now is think through the steps that you perform intuitively.

Think about all the steps for how you actually calculated the change to be given. The first secret is to realise that you need to start with the coin with the largest value, and then work down from there to the coin with the smallest value. The number of coins you give each time can then be calculated by dividing the amount of change to be given by the value of the current coin. Lastly you need to reduce the amount of change that remains to be given. These steps are shown in the pseudocode in [Listing x.y](#listingChangeCalculatorPseudoCode).

Program: Change Calculator
--------------------------
Constants:
    - TWO_DOLLARS with value 200
    - ONE_DOLLAR with value 100
    - FIFTY_CENTS with value 50
    - TWENTY_CENTS with value 20
    - TEN_CENTS with value 10
    - FIVE_CENTS with value 5
--------------------------
Methods: 
    - Get Change Value (), returns change value in cents
    - Coins To Give (Change, Coin Value), returns number of coins to give
    - Give Change (Change Value, Coin Value, Coin Description), no return value
--------------------------

Entry Point (Main):
--------------------------
Variables:
    - Change Value (Integer)
Steps:
    1. Assign to Change Value, the result of calling Get Change Value()
    2. Output 'Change: ' to the Terminal
    3. Call Give Change (Change Value, TWO_DOLLARS, '$2')
    4. Call Give Change (Change Value, ONE_DOLLAR, '$1')
    5. Call Give Change (Change Value, FIFTY_CENTS, '50c')
    6. Call Give Change (Change Value, TWENTY_CENTS, '20c')
    7. Call Give Change (Change Value, TEN_CENTS, '10c')
    8. Call Give Change (Change Value, FIVE_CENTS, '5c')
