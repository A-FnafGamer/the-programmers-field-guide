title: Change Calculator
---

[Table x.y](#tableChangeCalculator) contains a description of the program we are going to design. This program will calculate and output the ideal change for a given transaction. In designing this program, we will make use of the concepts introduced in this chapter; we will use variables to store values such as the amount paid, constants for the values of the different coins, and instructions to calculate and output the change expected.

| **Name** | *Change Calculator* |
| **Description** | Calculates the idea change for a given transaction in a Vending Machine. The transaction involves reading the cost of the item purchased and the amount paid, and then outputting the number of each type of coin to give as change. |

To design and implement this program we need to follow a number of steps:

1. Understand the problem, and get some ideas on the tasks that need to be performed.
2. Choose the building blocks we will create and use
3. Design the steps needed to achieve our goals
4. Map these building blocks and instructions to code
5. Compile and run the program
6. Test the program

This start by understanding what you want the program to do. This will involve determining the tasks to be performed, the steps involved in those tasks, and any data associated with them. Once you have a good understanding of what you want to achieve you can start to build a solution. In this step you determine the building blocks you want to create, and try to locate those you could use from the available libraries. Step 4 then turns your plans into source code that can be compiled and run in Step 5 and test in Step 6.

```bash
$ ./SimpleChange
Cost of item (in cents): 15
Amount paid (in cents): 500
Change: 2 x $2, 0 x $1, 1 x 50c, 1 x 20c, 1 x 10c, 1 x 5c

$ ./SimpleChange
Cost of item (in cents): 150
Amount paid (in cents): 250
Change: 0 x $2, 1 x $1, 0 x 50c, 0 x 20c, 0 x 10c, 0 x 5c

$ ./SimpleChange
Cost of item (in cents): 175 
Amount paid (in cents): 200
Change: 0 x $2, 0 x $1, 0 x 50c, 1 x 20c, 0 x 10c, 1 x 5c
```
