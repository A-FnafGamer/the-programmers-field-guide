Now that our program is making greater use of data it becomes more important to think about how to test your program. Testing is the process of trying to locate issues with your code. There are two main
classifications for issues, **syntactic errors** and **semantic errors**.

Syntactic errors indicate places in your code where you have not correctly followed the syntax of the language. These are the easiest kind of error to find as the compiler will not be able to compile the program if its syntax is not correct. The errors that the compiler report are all syntax errors. As you gain experience with a Language you will find that you make fewer and fewer of these kinds of errors.

Semantic errors, on the other hand, will not be found by the compiler. These are errors in the logic within the program. They are cases where you have correctly structured the code, but the code itself does not get the computer to perform the actions you require. These are the kinds of errors that you need to learn to be able to detect yourself. Selecting the right kind of test data is an important task when you start to think about testing programs.

For the Change Calculator there are two inputs provided by the user. In order to test this program you need to determine the values that are passed to the `Cost of the Item` and the `Payment` inputs. You want to choose values that can help you uncover any unexpected issues with the programs code.

| Cost of Item | Payment | Expected Output    | Reason |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| \$2.50       | \$5.00  | 1 x \$2, 1 x 50c   | Basic test to check that the program works for a simple data input.
| \$0.15       | \$4.00  | 1 of each coin     |  Generates \$3.85 in change, checking that each coin is used.
| \$0.05       | \$0.10  | 1 x 5c             |  Check the output can be a single coin. Could also add tests to check other individual coins.
| \$0.60       | \$1.00  | 2 x 20c            |  Check that 2 coins can be given.
| \$0.00       | \$5.00  | 2 x \$2, 1 x \$1   |  Can it accept no cost of item, and give back payment?
| \$3.85       | \$0.00  | -1 of each coin    |  Check what happens if insufficient funds are provided.

The data we use to test an execution of a program is called a **Test Case**. Each test case provides a set of input values, and the expected results given this input. Example test cases for the Change Calculator
are shown in [Table x.y](#tableTestData). This table shows the input values, the expected output values, and some rational for why this test case should be run. To perform the testing you run the program once for each test case and check the output of the program against the expected output. If there are any differences you know that their is a problem, and need to check the program's code to find the source of the logic errors.
