Receiving change from a transaction is something that you should be familiar with, and deter- mining the ideal change is not an overly complex task. While the task itself is common, it does not mean that you can skip thinking about it. If you had to give $6.50 in change you know without thinking that you should give three $2 coins, and one 50c coin. What you need to do now is think through the steps that you perform intuitively.

Put yourself in the place of the computer. You (as the computer) need to calculate and output these change values. Remember the computer is **unintelligent**. You cannot rely upon your knowledge, or remember anything that is not stored in a variable or constant. Try to think about the information you are using and the steps you are performing to make sure you can capture what needs to be done in your code.

This process is known as **computational thinking**. It is all about breaking ideas down into the small steps that the computer can perform. Outside of programming, these skills will help you become better at planning and thinking through steps in a methodical manner.

Think about the process of calculating change. At the start you need to determine the amount of change that needs to be given. Next you need to determine how many of each kind of coin you are going to give.

The main steps will need to be:

- Determine how much change to give.
  - Get the cost
  - Get the amount paid
  - Calculate the amount of change to provide
- Give change

We need to break down the "give change" step further.

The secret is to realise that we need to start with the coin with the largest value, and then work down from there to the coin with the smallest value. By starting with the largest value, we make sure that we remove the largest amount from the change value each time. With the $6.50 example, we remove 3 x $2 first, leaving 50c remaining. If we had started with 5c first, we would have given 130 5c coins.

:::tip[Integer Division]

When you do integer division, you get an integer. So 650 / 200 is 3.

The number of coins you give each time can then be calculated by dividing the amount of change to be given by the value of the current coin. Then reduce the amount of change that remains to be given.

Give change will involve

- Give $2 coins
  - Calculate the number of $2 coins to give (changeValue / 200)
  - Update the amount of change remaining to give
  - Output the number of $2
- Give $1 coins
  - Calculate the number of $1 coins to give
  - Update the amount of change remaining to give
  - Output the number of $1
- Give 50c coins
  - Calculate the number of 50c coins to give
  - Update the amount of change remaining to give
  - Output the number of 50c
- Give 20c coins
  - Calculate the number of 20c coins to give
  - Update the amount of change remaining to give
  - Output the number of 20c
- Give 10c coins
  - Calculate the number of 10c coins to give
  - Update the amount of change remaining to give
  - Output the number of 10c
- Give 5c coins
  - Calculate the number of 5c coins to give
  - Update the amount of change remaining to give
  - Output the number of 5c

Notice the steps are small and require no interpretation. You are close when you can list the instructions in this kind of detail.
