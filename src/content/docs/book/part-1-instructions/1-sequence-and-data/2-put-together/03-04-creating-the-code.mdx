## Writing the Code for the Change Calculator

The pseudocode from [Listing x.y](../03-01-understanding-the-change-calculator#listingChangeCalculatorPseudoCode) shows the instructions, and how these should be divided between the `Coins to Give` Function and `Output Change Data` Procedure. At this stage these instructions need to be translated into source code, so that they can be compiled and the resulting program tested.

The following sections [Section x.y I(mplementing the Change Calculator in C)](#), contains a
description of the syntax needed to create the program in the C programming language that include Variable and Function declarations.

:::note

Remember the basic process for reading the Syntax Diagrams is to:

1. Find the page with the Syntax rule you are interested in knowing about
2. Have a quick look at the Syntax Diagram and the rules it contains. Read each rule and get a basic feel for how it is going to come together for your program.
3. Read the example to see one way of using the Rule. The Syntax Diagram can be used to crate any number of variations of the rule, the example gives you at least one way these rules can be coded.
4. Return to the diagram and make sure you can match each part of the example back to the rule that created it.
5. Look up any related rules that are not explained on this rule's page.
