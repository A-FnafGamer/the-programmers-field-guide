The pseudocode shows the instructions we need to get this program working. At this stage these instructions need to be translated into source code, so that they can be compiled and the resulting program tested.

You have seen the syntax details for how to create programs, variables, and constants and how to code the instructions for method calls and assignment statements. Now all you need to do is apply those rules with the ideas captured in our pseudocode, and you will have something you can compile.

:::note

The next chapter, [Communicating Syntax](../../../2-communicating-syntax/0-overview) will be all about how to read and use the syntax diagrams that we have used to outline the syntax. For now you can use the examples to give you a good idea of how to code these instructions. To use the syntax diagrams directly you would:

1. Find the page with the Syntax rule you are interested in using
2. Have a quick look at the Syntax Diagram and the rules it contains. Read each rule and get a basic feel for how it is going to come together for your program.
3. Read the example to see one way of using the Rule. The Syntax Diagram can be used to create any number of variations of the rule, the example gives you at least one way these rules can be coded.
4. Return to the diagram and make sure you can match each part of the example back to the rule that created it.
5. Look up any related rules that are not explained on this rule's page.

## Start your project

Remember the steps to get going with a new program:

1. Open the Terminal
2. `cd` to your projects folder
3. `mkdir` something called **ChangeCalculator** maybe
4. `cd ./ChangeCalculator`
5. `dotnet new console`
6. `vscode .`

This will set up the project through the terminal, then launch vscode to get started coding.

Now you just need to convert the pseudocode to code.

Have a go at this yourself.

:::tip

I'd suggest the following process:

- Declare the constants first
- Open a terminal and build to make sure you have no errors
- Read in the values from the user, and output them just to check
- Run it in the terminal
- Calculate the change, output that, and run again
- Add each coins calculation one at a time - building and running as you go

Code is easy to make mistakes with, so build a little and test how it is going. Do not write this all at once. That usually results in it taking longer.

## Compiler Errors

A compiler is a very sensitive piece of software; they require that you
follow the language's syntax *precisely*. One small mistake, and the
compiler will fail to compile your program and end with an error
message. This is a *good* thing! (Although it may not feel like it at
first.) Why? Because when programs become complicated we need the exact
details to help us, and to assure the program works the way we need it
to.

Here are some handy hints related to dealing with compiler errors.

1. **Know that errors are inevitable**. You will get compiler errors!
    As you gain more experience you will get fewer errors, but it will
    always be a rare event that everything is exactly as it should be
    the first time.

2. **Error messages may appear cryptic at first**. In many cases the
    compiler's error messages can appear cryptic, you need to learn to
    decode the messages the compiler gives you.

3. **Start with the first error message, and do not move on until it is fixed**. The compiler will read your code 'top down'.
    So the first error it outputs will be the first in the file. The
    problem is that the compiler will *try* to continue on, despite the
    error. This can mean that other errors further on in the output may
    actually be caused by the compiler being *confused* due to the first
    error. By fixing the first error you may also fix subsequent errors.

4. **Deal with one error at a time**. It is easy to feel
    overwhelmed when you see a huge list of errors, but do not be scared
    off! Start at the first error, and solve them one by one. Compile
    after fixing each problem to see if the others still exist.

5. **Do not add more code until the errors are fixed**. Compile your
    program frequently. Add small pieces of functionality, and then fix
    any syntax errors before adding the next piece of functionality.
    Coding in this way makes sure that you do not get too many errors,
    and reduces the code you have to search in order to fix the problems.

6. **Read the error message carefully**. The message will
    *try* to tell you what has gone wrong, and once you understand what
    the messages are trying to say you will be able to find and fix the
    issues quickly.

7. **Work out what the error messages mean**. Understanding the error
    messages will mean that you will know what to look for, and will
    help you avoid these errors in the future. If your not sure what an
    error message means ask others developers or search for the message
    on the internet.

8. **Find the line and character number of
    the error**. One important detail in the error message will be the
    line number of the error. This gives you a starting point to help
    you locate the problem. It is important to note that this is where
    the compiler got to when it noticed the error - this *does not* mean
    this is where the error actually is (but it is a good place to start
    looking). You may need to look back one or more lines to find the
    actual source of the problem.

9. **Watch for typos**. It is easy to mistype an identifier. When this
    happens the compiler will not know what to do (and it will complain
    about you trying to use 'unknown' things). Make sure you check for
    these tiny typos when you get errors related to the compiler not
    being able to find an identifier.

10. **When you get stuck ask for help**. Compiler errors
    are likely to be something small, but sometimes the causes are hard
    to find. If you get stuck, *ask for help*! Having access to other
    more experienced developers will be a valuable resource as you learn
    to program. Learning to program can be tough at times, and having
    someone who can help you when you get stuck will make all the
    difference.
