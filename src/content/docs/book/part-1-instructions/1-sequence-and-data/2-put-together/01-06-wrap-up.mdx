Hopefully this has helped you see how you can put the concepts from this chapter to work. The main thing is to think about what you want to achieve, and work out the small steps that you will need the computer to perform to achieve this. Once you have this basic outline of the process in mind, you can identify the variables and constants you will need to achieve this, remembering that the computer is unintelligent, so you need to have all the information somewhere in the code for you to use. With this more complete plan, you can use the syntax of the programming language to help you convert your ideas into code the programming language tools can use.

## Change Calculator Code

Make sure you had a go at coding the change calculator yourself. Avoid using tools like GitHub Co-Pilot for the moment. These tools can help generate code for you, but you want to know how to do this yourself first. Similarly, copying the code that is provided won't help you understand how to do this yourself. Even just the practice of typing this in yourself will help you think through each of these steps.

Here is what I came up with for the change calculator code. I decided not to have a separate `line` variable, but it would probably have been better to include that. I made sure to lay out the code with gaps and comments to help me see the different steps. Your code is probably very similar to this as we were both working from the same pseudocode plan. Your program does not need to be exactly the same as this, but hopefully reviewing this and comparing it with your program will give you confidence that you are on the right path.

```csharp
/*
* Program: Simple Change
* Calculate the ideal change for a given transaction.
*/
using static System.Console;
using static System.Convert;

// Constants for the coin values
const int TWO_DOLLARS = 200;
const int ONE_DOLLAR = 100;
const int FIFTY_CENTS = 50;
const int TWENTY_CENTS = 20;
const int TEN_CENTS = 10;
const int FIVE_CENTS = 5;

// Get the data from the user
Write("Cost of item in cents: ");
int costOfItem = ToInt32(ReadLine());

Write("Payment in cents: ");
int amountPaid = ToInt32(ReadLine());

// Calculate the change
int changeValue = costOfItem - amountPaid;
int toGive;

// Give Change
Write("Change: ");

// Give $2
toGive = changeValue / TWO_DOLLARS;
changeValue = changeValue - toGive * TWO_DOLLARS;
Write($"{toGive} x $2, ");

// Give $1
toGive = changeValue / ONE_DOLLARS;
changeValue = changeValue - toGive * ONE_DOLLAR;
Write($"{toGive} x $1, ");

// Give 50c
toGive = changeValue / FIFTY_CENTS;
changeValue = changeValue - toGive * FIFTY_CENTS;
Write($"{toGive} x 50c, ");

// Give 20c
toGive = changeValue / TWENTY_CENTS;
changeValue = changeValue - toGive * TWENTY_CENTS;
Write($"{toGive} x 20c, ");

// Give 10c
toGive = changeValue / TEN_CENTS;
changeValue = changeValue - toGive * TEN_CENTS;
Write($"{toGive} x 10c, ");

// Give 5c
toGive = changeValue / FIVE_CENTS;
changeValue = changeValue - toGive * FIVE_CENTS;
Write($"{toGive} x 5c");

// End the line... then end the program
WriteLine();
```

:::tip
The comments helped me track the steps as I went. These will make it easier when I come back to look at this in a few months, when I have forgotten what I was doing now.

Let's have a look at a couple of extra example programs. These will help you see and practice the programming process.
