Now it is time to build something yourself. Use the concepts and processes that we have described throughout Part 1 to design and implement at least one of these programs.

If you have access to others learning to program, this can be a great time to talk them through how you approached this. Share the challenges you faced, and the strategies you used. Listen to how they approached things, and try to learn from their experiences.

If you have access to others with more experience, explain your programs to them and use them to help you when your rubber ducky debugging doesn't help you find the solution to your current problem. Don't let them give you the answer, get them to ask you questions to help you find the answer yourself. After all, you want to master these skills to help ensure you understand how computers works and how to make effective use of them.

## Projects

Here are some project ideas to get you going.

**TODO: Add activities**

### Reaction Time

Create a graphical application to capture reaction times. Show a shape and record the time it takes for the user to hit the space bar after the shape is drawn.

- Ask the user how many tests they want to perform in the terminal at the start.
- Give the user the instructions in the terminal
  - Ask the user to hit the space key after they see something on the screen (a circle maybe)
  - Get them to acknowledge this before continuing
- Show the window, where you will draw something.
- Use some timing code to delay and show the shape for the start of the reaction test.
- Record how long the user took to respond
- Print out a log of the times to the terminal
- Print the average reaction time at the end of the program, after the indicated number of tests.

### Accuracy Test

Create a graphical application that gets the user to indicate the midpoint between two circles.

- Ask the user how many tests they want to perform in the terminal at the start.
- Give the user the instructions in the terminal
  - Ask the user to click the mid-point between two circles
  - Get them to acknowledge this before continuing
- Show the window
- Draw two random circles (of fixed size)
- Get the coordinate the user clicks, and output how far off they were for both the x and y coordinate in the test. Keep a sum of these two differences so that you can output a summary at the end.
- Print the average x and y offsets at the end of the program, after the indicated number of tests.
