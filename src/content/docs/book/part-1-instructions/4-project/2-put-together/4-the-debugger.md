When the problem isn't evident despite thinking it through thoroughly, you can turn to the debugger for help. Use the debugger to step through the code to inspect values as they change. Add a breakpoint near the error, and then step through observing variable and expression values.

This is where features such as [Logpoints](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_logpoints) and [Data Inspection](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_data-inspection) tools can come in handy. You can set a logpoints to have it output values as the program runs, or use data inspection tools to watch values of expressions as you step through the program. Logpoints are particularly helpful for the more interactive programs, such as the games you are creating, as it can log the value of the expression without needing to stop the program running.
