title: Other Languages
---

Structured programming ideas underpin all modern imperative programming languages. Focus on the concepts, and once you master these ideas here, with one language, you will be able to apply the same thinking to others.

So how similar are other languages?

If we consider a language like Python, you will find it has basically the same control flow mechanisms:

- Branches include the
  - [if statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#if)
  - [match statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-match-statement) which is equivalent to C#'s switch.
- Loops include:
  - [while loop](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#while)
  - [for loop](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements)

Notice that not only are the same kind of structures present, most of them even use the same keywords. Languages generally spell `if` in the same way.

If you can think through the program at a pseudocode level, then the logic will generally translate between languages.

Focus on the concepts, and how they apply. Once you have seen the range of tools, you will be able to switch easily between languages.

The main challenge with learning a new language will be learning the range of tools that the language comes with, and how to effectively use these.
