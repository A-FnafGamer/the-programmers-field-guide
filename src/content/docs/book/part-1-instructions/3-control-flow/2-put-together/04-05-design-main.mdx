## Designing Control Flow for Main

The last Procedure is `Main`. This is responsible for coordinating the actions of the program. It will call `Play Game` in a loop that repeatedly plays the game until the user decides to quit. `Main` will have one local variable called `again`. This will store a character, and will be used to store the value read from the user's response to the '*play again*' prompt.

:::note
Computers cannot generate truly random numbers. Instead it uses a numeric sequence that appears to be random. Seeding the generator with the current time ensures that this random sequence starts at a different value each time the program is run.
