Before examining the control flows within the Change Calculator, let us have a look at a means of visually representing the flow of instructions within code. A common means of doing this is to use a **flowchart**. This is a diagram that depicts a sequence of actions, and can be used to represent the sequence of instructions that occur within your code.

The flowchart has four basic symbols as shown in [Figure x.y](#FigureGuessThatNumberFlowChartSymbols).

- **Start/Stop**: This represents the start and end of the process. Typically, the start node can have text to indicate the part of the code that is being visualised.
- **Flow**: The arrows between nodes represent control flow, indicating which action is to be performed next in the code.
- **Process**: This node represents a task being performed. In our case this will map to one, or more, simple statements (assignment statements or method calls). The text in the process node should indicate what is being performed at this stage. Each process can only have a single flow coming from it, as these processes are performed in sequence.
- **Decision**: This represents a point where the code needs to make a decision. This represents a location where we have a [branching](../../1-concepts/03-0-branching) or [looping](../../1-concepts/04-0-looping) statement. The text in the decision represents the condition that will determine which path is taken. A decision **must** have more than one flow coming out of it, and each flow should indicate the condition that triggers that path.

## Structured Programming and Flowcharts

Flowcharts can be used to represent *any* sequence of actions, but not all sequences of actions will be easy to code. [Figure x.y](#FigureUnstructuredFlowChart) is an example of a flowchart that captures a joke about changing things. This flowchart is **not** one that can be coded using the structured statements covered in this chapter. Notice that the paths in this flowchart are interwoven. There are some steps that appear in multiple paths, making it impossible to code this using the structured programming principles.

Taking responsibility for your actions is always the best policy, but that doesn't make as interesting a joke.

[Figure x.y](#FigureStructuredFlowChart) shows a structured version of this same algorithm. Notice that in this version there are identifiable blocks, each having a single entry and a single exit. This structure could easily be converted to code using structured statements.

Looking at these two flowcharts, the structured flowchart involves more processes, but allows us to organise these so that each block has a single entry and single exist. This reflects the fact that in some cases the structured version may be more involved, but is also an indication that this process may be better broken down in other ways as we will see soon.

The structured programming principles indicate that code within our programs should be organised into **blocks**. These blocks match to the structured statements in modern programming languages: the [branching](../../1-concepts/03-0-branching) and [looping](../../1-concepts/04-0-looping) statements. Each of these blocks has a **single entry point** and a **single exit point**, allowing them to be combined in a way that is easy to follow in the code.

The addition of [jumping](../../1-concepts/05-0-jumping) statements to the language allows the blocks to have **multiple exit points**; one at the end of the block's code, the other at a break or continue statement. These statements give you extra flexibility, but still work within the general goals of the structured programming principles to help create readable code.

:::note

Prior to the structured programming, programs had two control flow mechanisms: `if` and `goto`. Control flow was not easy to picture or understand. Programs written in this way are now known as **spaghetti code**, as understanding this code is much like trying to untangle a bowl of spaghetti, though not nearly as tasty.

## Designing blocks to achieve goals

In structured programming there are three kinds of blocks:

- **Sequence**: one instruction follows the next in a sequence.
- **Selection**: the ability to branch the sequence.
- **Repetition**: repeat a block a number of times.

The flowchart snippets in the section on branching and looping showed how the flows work for *selection* and *repetition*. [Figure x.y](#FigureGuessThatNumberSequenceBlocks) shows the three alternatives for selection blocks, [Figure x.y](#FigureGuessThatNumberSelectionBlocks) shows the two alternatives for repetition blocks, and [Figure x.y](#FigureGuessThatNumberRepetitionBlocks) shows the standard sequence flow. The design of any program's logic is a task in combining these blocks together to perform the desired effect.
