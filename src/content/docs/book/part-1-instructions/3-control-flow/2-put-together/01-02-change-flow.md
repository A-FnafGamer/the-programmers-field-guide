We can use a flowchart to help us capture the sequence that currently exists within the change calculator. This can be captured at the high level, allowing us to see how the main steps of the program are sequenced.

- At the moment, the **Give Change** step is the sequence that involves calculating and providing change for each coin type.
- There are no decisions in this flow, the program is just the sequence of actions.
