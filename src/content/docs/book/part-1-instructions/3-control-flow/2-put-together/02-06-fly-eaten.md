Now to finish this off - the spider needs to be able to catch the fly.

SplashKit includes some shape testing methods that we can use to help here. These allow you to check things like two shapes intersecting.

|**Method** | **Required Arguments** |**Description** |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------|
|`CirclesIntersect`| The x, y, and radius of 2 circles (6 arguments) | Returns true if the two circles intersect (overlap) each other. |
|`CirclesAtPoint`| The x, y, and radius of a circle, and the x and y value for a point | Returns true if the point is within the circle. |
