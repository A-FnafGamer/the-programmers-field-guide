## Drawing control flow using a Flowchart

Before examining the control flows within the Functions and Procedures of the Guess that Number program, let us have a look at a means of visually representing flow of actions within code. A common means of doing this is to use a **flowchart**. This is a diagram that depicts a sequence of actions, and can be used to represent the sequence of action actions that occur within your code.


The flowchart has four basic symbols as shown in [Figure x.y](#FigureGuessThatNumberFlowChartSymbols).

- **Start/Stop**: This represents the start and end of the process. Typically the start node would have the name of the Function or Procedure within it.
- **Flow**: The arrows between nodes represent control flow, indicating which action is to be performed next in the code.
- **Process**: This node represents a task being performed. In our case this will map to one, or more, simple statements. The text in the Process node should indicate what is being performed at this stage.
- **Decision**: This represents a point where the code needs to make a decision. This is used for the conditions in the Branching and Looping statements. A decision **must** have more than one flow coming out of it, and each flow should indicate the condition that triggers that path.

## Use Structured Programming Principles to guide the design of the flowchart

Flowcharts can be used to represent any sequence of actions, but not all sequences of actions will be easy to code. [Figure x.y](#FigureUnstructuredFlowChart) is an example of a flowchart, but not one that can be coded using the structured statements covered in this chapter. [Figure x.y](#FigureStructuredFlowChart) shows a structured version of this same algorithm. Notice that in this version there are identifiable blocks, each having a single entry and a single exit. This structure could easily be converted to code using structured statements.

Looking at these two flowcharts, the structured flowchart looks more complicated than the unstructured version. This reflects the fact that in some cases the structured version may be more complicated, but is also an indication that this process may be better broken down into more functions and procedures. For example, the repeated loop looking for someone else to blame could be placed in its own procedure. If you find it difficult to design the control flow using structured blocks try to see if you can identify additional Functions and Procedures to help you break the code down into smaller blocks.

The structured programming principles indicate that code within a Function or Procedure should be organised into **blocks**. These blocks match to the structured statements in modern programming languages: the Branching and Looping statements. Each of these blocks has a **single entry point** and a **single exit point**, allowing them to combined together.

The addition of Jumping statements to the language allows the blocks to have **multiple exit points**; one at the end of the block's code, the other at a Break, Exit, or Return Statement. These statements give you extra flexibility, but still work within the structured programming principles.

:::note

Prior to the Structured Programming, programs had two control flow mechanisms: `if` and `Goto`. Control flow was not easy to pucture or understand. Programs written in this way are now known as **spaghetti code**, as understanding this code is much like trying to untangle a bowl of spaghetti, though not nearly as tasty.

## The Structured Programming blocks used to build the logic 

In Structured Programming there are three kinds of blocks:
-  **Sequence**: one instruction follows the next in a sequence.
-  **Selection**: the ability to branch the sequence.
-  **Repetition**: repeat a block a number of times.

The flowchart snippets in the section on Branching and Looping showed how the flows work for *selection* and *repetition*. [Figure x.y](#FigureGuessThatNumberSequenceBlocks) shows the three alternatives for selection blocks, [Figure x.y](#FigureGuessThatNumberSelectionBlocks) shows the two alternatives for repetition blocks, and [Figure x.y](#FigureGuessThatNumberRepetitionBlocks) shows the standard sequence flow. The design of any program's logic is a task in combining these blocks together to perform the desired effect.
