title: Jumping Statements
---

See how jumping statements allow you to break out of loops, and return from methods.

By default all programming control flow statements are organised so that there is a clear entry point and exit point. The loops have a start point, and an end point. The branching statements, branch out and then come back together to continue on.

This is a key concept for structured programming. Control flow is organised in blocks that can be put together to structure the program's code.

The jumping statement allows you to break out of this strict structure when needed. There are three main jumping statements: **break**, **continue**, and **return**.

## Break Statement

The **break** statement allows you to end a loop, or jump to the end of a case statement. The following loop will end if the user types the Escape key.

```cs
Window mainWindow = new Window("...", 400, 225);

while ( ! mainWindow.CloseRequested )
{
  SplashKit.ProcessEvents();

  if ( SplashKit.KeyTyped( KeyCode.EscapeKey )) break;
  //...
}
```

## Continue Statement

The **continue** statement allows you to jump to the loop test, and continue from there. This allows you to skip some of the loop body.

In the following code, the continue is used to skip the printing out of the value if times is divisible by 2.

```cs
int times = 0;

while ( times < 10)
{
  times++;
  if ( times % 2 == 0) continue;

  Console.WriteLine($"Times is {times}");
}
```

The mod operator (`%`) returns the remainder after division, so the condition `times % 2 == 0` is true when the remainder after dividing times by 2 is 0.

## Return

The **return** statement is used to return from a method to its caller. This can be at the end of the method, but can also be placed within the body of the method.

When the method returns a value, the return statement must provide that value. This value is then returned to the caller.

The following code has three different points at which it could end. The if statements within the body of the method determine which value is returned, and as a result where the method terminates.

```cs

int sign(double val)
{
  if ( val > 0 ) return 1;
  if ( val < 0 ) return -1;
  return 0;
}
```

if the value is larger than 0, then the first if condition is true and the method ends when it returns 1. This means that the remainder of the method's instructions as skipped, as control has _returned_ to the caller.

### Your Task

Languages also offer a `goto` statement, but this is generally considered bad practice to use. Why do you think this is? This [xkcd comic](https://www.xkcd.com/292/) may hold the answer.
