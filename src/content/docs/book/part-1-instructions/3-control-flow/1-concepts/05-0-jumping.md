## Concept

The jump statements allow you to alter the sequence of instructions in the code, getting the computer to jump to another instruction.

:::note

- The jump statements are **actions**, they allow you to alter the standard sequence of the instructions and have the computer jump to another location in the instructions.
- **Structured Programming** was proposed as a means of providing order and structure to the control flow through the code. These jump statements complicate this sequential flow, but in some cases they are able to simplify code.
- Structured jump statements allow you to control the sequence of actions related to a [Looping](../03-looping) statement, a [Function](#), or a [Method](../../../1-sequence-and-data/1-concepts/02-method). These work the looping and procedural structures used in structured programming
- Unstructured jump statements allow you to jump to any instruction within the code. You need to be aware that these statements exist, but they should not be used.
