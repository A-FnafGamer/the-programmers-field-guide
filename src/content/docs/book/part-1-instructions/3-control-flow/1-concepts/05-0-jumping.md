The jump statements allow you to alter the sequence of instructions in the code, getting the computer to jump to another instruction.

:::note

- The jump statements are **instructions**, they allow you to alter the standard sequence of the instructions and have the computer jump to another location in the instructions.
- **Structured Programming** was proposed as a means of providing order and structure to the control flow through the code. These jump statements complicate this sequential flow, so you should take care with some of these.
- Structured jump statements allow you to control the sequence of actions related to a [looping](../03-looping) statement.
- Unstructured jump statements allow you to jump to any instruction within the code. You need to be aware that these statements exist, but they should not be used.

:::

The three jump statements we will look at now include [break](../05-1-break), [continue](../05-2-continue), and the infamous [goto](../05-3-goto).
