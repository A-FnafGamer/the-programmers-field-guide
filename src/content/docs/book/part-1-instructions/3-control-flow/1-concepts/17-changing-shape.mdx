See how to use enumerations and control flow to allow the user to change the kind of ship they are controlling.

With the space game we could make use of an enumeration to allow the user to switch between different kinds of ships. To do this we create a `ShipKind` enumeration, and add a field to the ship so that it remembers which kind it is. We can then make use of this when the ship is drawn.

Reflect on your reading about enumerations, and the features of C#. Can you think of an easier way to select the image than using a switch statement?
