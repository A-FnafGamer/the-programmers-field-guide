The Boolean<sup>[1](#FootnoteGeorgeBool)</sup> [Type](../../../1-sequence-and-data/1-concepts/07-type) is used to represent **truth**. A Boolean value will either be **true** or **false**. These values are used extensively in the control flow statements to determine which instruction to perform next.
