The last jump statement is the goto statement. This is an unstructured jump, allowing you to jump anywhere in the code. Structured Programming principles called for the abolition of the goto statement. This is a statement you need to be aware of, but not one that should be used.

Why?

The following comic demonstrates the hazards of using the goto statement.

Seriously, the goto statement isn't something that you are ever likely to need. If you think you need, there will be other ways to achieve your goals.

:::note

- Goto is an **instruction** that allows you to jump to another instruction.
- You need to be aware of the goto statement, but you should not use it
