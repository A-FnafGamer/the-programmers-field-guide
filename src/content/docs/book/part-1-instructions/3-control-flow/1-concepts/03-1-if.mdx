The if statement is the most frequently used branching statement. It allows you to selectively run code based on the value of a Boolean expression (the condition). The if statement has an optional *else* branch that is executed when the condition is false.

<div class="caption"><span class="caption-figure-nbr">Figure x.y: </span>If statement lets you selectively run a branch of code</div><br/>

:::note

- An if statement is an **instruction**. It allows you to command the computer to select a path based on a [boolean expression](../01-boolean-data).
- The if statement has **two** branches, one that is taken when the condition is true, the other when it is false.
- The false branch may *optionally* have instructions that are carried out when the condition is not met.
- If there are no instructions you want performed when the condition is false, you do not need to include an else branch. In this case, the if statement will just skip the true branch when the condition is false.
- The if statement has one entry point, two paths, and then one exit point.

:::

## If Staement - Why, When, and How

The if statement will be a regular feature in your programs. You will use this anywhere you want to optionally run a block of code. The condition has to be a boolean expression, which you can then use comparisons and logical operators to create. You then provide code within the if statement to run when the condition is true. You can also optionally include an *else* branch for when the condition is false.

Remember that things still run in **sequence**, so you have to position the if statement within your sequence at the right location. Then set the condition, and program the instructions to run within the if statement, and those to run when it is false if needed.

## In C#

:::tip[Syntax]

The syntax for an if statement in C# uses the `if` keyword, followed by the condition in parenthesis, then the statement to run for when the condition is true. This can optionally be followed by the `else` keyword and a statement to run when the condition is false. To run more than one statement in either of these branches requires the use of a [compound statament](../02-compound-statement).

![An if statement visualisation showing a single entry into the if, two branches selected based on the condition, joining back together before the next statement.](./images/if-statement.png)

:::
## How does if work?

Let's work through a few examples to see how the if statement works. Pay attention to how this fits within the sequence of actions in the code. Understanding how this works will help you see how to make use of it within your projects.

We can look at running code if a condition is true, running different code when it is false, and combining if statements for more than two paths.

:::tip[Remember]

Control flow statements all utilise the **conditional jump**. This is a very simple mechanism, so you need to add the creativity to see how to use this to achieve your ends.

:::

### Standalone if

You can use an **if statement** to selectively run a block of code when a condition is true. In the following code, we ask the user to tell us which language they use. Then the **if** allows us to check *if* the language is "C#", and when that is true have the computer output a custom message. This is achieved by skipping over those statements when the condition is false.

```csharp
using static System.Console;

string language;

Write("What language do you use? ");
language = ReadLine();

if (language == "C#")
{
    WriteLine("Good choice, C# is a fine language.");
}

WriteLine("Great chat!");
```

Step through the following images to see key points about how this runs within the computer. Pay attention to the actions of the if statement itself.

<MySwiper client:only height="" images={sliderImagesIfStatement}></MySwiper>

:::tip[Attention]

Notice the actions of the if - evaluate the condition. If true, run the statement that follows. If false, jump over the statement that follows.

That is all the if does.

:::

### if with else

We can add `else` to have a second branch that gets run only when the condition is false. The following code adds an else branch to output a different message when the user enters anything other than "C#".

```csharp
using static System.Console;

string language;

Write("What language do you use? ");
language = ReadLine();

if (language == "C#")
{
    WriteLine("Good choice, C# is a fine language.");
}
else
{
    WriteLine("Well... good luck with that!");
}

WriteLine("Great chat!");
```

The else adds to the actions the if statement needs to perform. Review the following images to see how this works.

<MySwiper client:only height="" images={sliderImagesIfElseStatement}></MySwiper>

:::tip[Attention]

This is the full set of the if statement actions. They are:

1. Evaluate condition
2. If true, run the statement following the 'if'.
3. If false, jump to the statement following 'else' or the end of the if
4. At the else, jump to the end of the if

When thinking through your code, you need to do the same in your head.

- "If this is true, run this code and skip that code" and...
- "if this is false, skip this code and run that code".

:::

### Multiple if statements combined

In many cases you will want more than two paths. To achieve this, you need to combine together multiple if statements as shown in the following code. This adds a checks for C and C++ to give them different outputs as well.

```csharp
using static System.Console;

string language;

Write("What language do you use? ");
language = ReadLine();

if (language == "C#")
{
    WriteLine("Good choice, C# is a fine language.");
}
else if (language == "C" || language = "C++")
{
    WriteLine("These are great low level languages - we will be using these soon!");
}
else
{
    WriteLine("Well... good luck with that!");
}

WriteLine("Great chat!");
```

Review the following images to see how the two if statements work together.

<MySwiper client:only height="" images={sliderImagesIfElseIfStatement}></MySwiper>

:::tip[Attention]

Notice how the one statement in the **else** branch can be an **if statement**. When the else is skipped, that means this if statement is skipped.
