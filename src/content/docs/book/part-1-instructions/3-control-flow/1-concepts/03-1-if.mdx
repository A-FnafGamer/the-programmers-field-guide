The if statement is the most frequently used branching statement. It allows you to selectively run code based on the value of a Boolean expression (the condition). The if statement has an optional *else* branch that is executed when the condition is false.

<div class="caption"><span class="caption-figure-nbr">Figure x.y: </span>If statement lets you selectively run a branch of code</div><br/>

:::note

- An if statement is an **instruction**. It allows you to command the computer to select a path based on a [boolean expression](../01-boolean-data).
- The if statement has **two** branches, one that is taken when the condition is true, the other when it is false.
- The false branch may *optionally* have instructions that are carried out when the condition is not met.
- If there are no instructions you want performed when the condition is false, you do not need to include an else branch. In this case, the if statement will just skip the true branch when the condition is false.
- The if statement has one entry point, two paths, and then one exit point.

### How does the if statement work?

Lets work through a few examples. We can look at running code if a condition is true, running different code when it is false, and combining if statements for more than two paths.

#### Standalone if statement

You can use an **if statement** to selectively run a block of code when a condition is true. In the following code, we ask the user to tell us which language they use. Then the **if** allows us to check *if* the language is "C#", and when that is true have the computer output a custom message. This is achieved by skipping over those statements when the condition is false.

```csharp
using static System.Console;

string language;

Write("What language do you use? ");
language = ReadLine();

if (language == "C#")
{
    WriteLine("Good choice, C# is a fine language.");
}

WriteLine("Great chat!");
```
#### How it works

#### if / 'else if' statement

```csharp
using static System.Console;

string language;

Write("What language do you use? ");

language = ReadLine();

if (language == "C#")
{
    WriteLine("Good choice, C# is a fine language.");
}
else
{
    WriteLine("Well... good luck with that!");
}

WriteLine("Great chat!");
```

#### if / 'else if' / else statement

```csharp
using static System.Console;

string language;

Write("What language do you use? ");

language = ReadLine();

if (language == "C#")
{
    WriteLine("Good choice, C# is a fine language.");
}
else if (language == "C" || language = "C++")
{
    WriteLine("These are great low level languages - we will be using these soon!");
}
else
{
    WriteLine("Well... good luck with that!");
}

WriteLine("Great chat!");
```
