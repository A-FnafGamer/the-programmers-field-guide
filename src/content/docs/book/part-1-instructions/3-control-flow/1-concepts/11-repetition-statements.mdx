title: Repetition Statements
---

Repetition statements allow you to easily repeat a path a number of times, allowing you to repeat code a variable number of times.

As we have seen, sequence is the basis of control flow. Instructions run, one after the other. One challenge with this is that you often want to have some steps repeated, and we want to be able to do this without having to repeat instructions in the code.

To solve this, programming languages introduce repetition (or looping) statements. These allow you to use boolean conditions to control how often instructions within the loop execute.

In general the repetition statements have a test, at either the start or the of the block of code you want to repeat. When the test is evaluated, it checks if the computer should loop back and repeat the instructions within the loop.

When the test is at the start of the block, the loop may be executed _0 to many_ times. These loops are called **pre-test** loops.

When the test is at the end of the block the loop must execute its instructions at least once, running the loop _1 to many_ times. These loops are called **post-test** loops.

## Pre-test: While Loop

![This diagram shows a visual representation of the switch statement](./images/sit771-WhileLoop.png)

In C#, the most common loop is the **while** loop. This loop evaluates the condition at the start of the loop.

The following code is an example of the while loop. At the start of the loop it checks the condition `times > 0`, initially times is 10 so this is true. As this is true, control flows into the body of the loop.

When the body runs, it decrements the value in times and prints out its new value (9). When control reaches the end of the loop it jumps back to the test, allowing the test to be evaluated again. If the test then the body is executed again.

This process continues with the code in the body of the loop repeating **while** the condition is true.

In this case, `times` eventually reaches 0. When control reaches the end of the loop it jumps back and evaluates the condition again. As the condition is no longer true, control jumps over the body of the loop, and the loop ends.

```cs
int times = 10;
Console.WriteLine("Times: {times}");
while ( times > 0 )
{
  times--; // times = times - 1;
  Console.WriteLine("Times is now {times}");
}
Console.WriteLine("After the loop");
```

The above example loops a fixed number of times, using the `times` variable to count the repetitions and using this variable within the condition.

You can also use loops that run based on other kinds of conditions. For example, the following loop keeps running while the user has not closed the window.

```cs
Window mainWindow = new Window("...", 400, 225);

while ( ! mainWindow.CloseRequested )
{
  SplashKit.ProcessEvents();

  w.Clear(Color.White);
  w.Refresh();
}
w.Close();
```

This loop keeps checking if the user has closed the window. When they have asked to closed the window, the loop will end and the code closes the Window. After all, it is the code and not the user who is really in control.

## Post-test: Do While Loop

![This diagram shows a visual representation of the switch statement](./images/sit771-DoWhileLoop.png)

The **do while** loop is similar to the while loop, but it checks the condition at the end the loop. This means control must flow through the loop body before it gets to the test.

```cs
int times;
times = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
Console.WriteLine("Times: {times}");
do
{
  times--; // times = times - 1;
  Console.WriteLine("Times is now {times}");
} while ( times > 0 );
Console.WriteLine("After the loop");
```
Notice that in the above code, the while test is at the end of the loop. This means if the user enters 0 or a negative number, the loop body will still run once before it gets to the test to check if the code should run again.

When the user does enter a value larger than 1, the loop will evaluate the condition at the end. If the condition is true, control jumps back to the start of the loop and the instructions run again.

If the test at the end of the loop is false, then control continues to the next statement: the one after the loop.

Remember that with the loops the instructions are still run in sequence. This means that the tests are only checked at the start or end of the loop body.

### Your Task

Which of the two kinds of loops do you think would be used more often? The while or do..while loop? Can you think of a reason why this may be?
