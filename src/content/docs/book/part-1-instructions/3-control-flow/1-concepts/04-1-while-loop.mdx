```csharp
using static System.Console;
using static System.Convert;

int target;

Write("Count to: ");
target = ToInt32(ReadLine());

int i =  0;

while (i < target)
{
  WriteLine(i);
  i++;
}
```

#### How does it work?

```csharp

OpenWindow("Circle Test", 400, 400);
ClearScreen(ColorWhite());

while (not WindowCloseRequested())
