The break statement is used to jump out of the current loop, in effect terminating the loop early. This is useful for ending the current loop, skipping all future cycles.

:::note

- The break statement is an **action**, allowing you to jump to the end of the current loop. 
- The break statement should be coded within an [Branching](../02-branching) statement that checks if the loop should terminate early.
