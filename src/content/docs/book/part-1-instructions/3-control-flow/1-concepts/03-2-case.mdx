The case statement is the second kind of branching statement. This allows you to create paths that execute based on matching a value from an expression. This allows one case statement to handle many alternative paths.

:::note

- The case statement is a kind of **action**. It allows you to command the computer to select a path based upon the value of an expression.
- Each path within the Case Statement has a value. When the computer executes the case statement the path values are used to determine which path will be taken. 
- In C and Pascal the Case Statement only works with Ordinal Values. This limits you to using Character or Integer values within the Case Statementâ€™s Expression.
- The Case Statement has one entry point, multiple paths, and then one exit point.

### How does the case statement work?

```csharp
using static System.Console;
using static System.Convert;

WriteLine("1: [S]ay Hello");
WriteLine("2: Option 2");
WriteLine("3: Say Bye");
WriteLine();
Write("Option> ");

string option = ReadLine();

switch(option)
{
  case "1":
  case "S":
  case "s":
    WriteLine("Hello");
    break;
  case "2":
    WriteLine("Option 2");
    break;
  case "3":
    WriteLine("Bye");
    break;
  default:
    WriteLine("Not a valid option");
}
```

**TODO: slides - show from option = ... demo with "s" and "3" and "other"**

```csharp
using static System.Console;

string language;

Write("What language do you use? ");
language = ReadLine();

switch (language)
{
  case "C#":
    WriteLine("Good choice, C# is a fine language.");
    break;
  case "C":
  case "C++":
    WriteLine("These are great low level languages - we will be using these soon!");
    break;
  default:
    WriteLine("Well... good luck with that!");
}

WriteLine("Great chat!");
```
