## Concept

[Branching](../02-branching) and [Looping](../03-looping) and statements need to be able to include a number of instructions within their paths. Often languages will manage this by indicating that only a *single* statement can be included in any of these paths, and then include the ability to code multiple statements in a *single compound statement*.

:::note

- *Compound Statement* is a **term** used to describe a way of grouping *actions*, allowing you to create a single statement that contains multiple statements. 
- Compound Statements are useful when combined with [Branching](../02-branching) and [Looping](../03-looping) statements. Allowing you to put multiple statements within a path.
