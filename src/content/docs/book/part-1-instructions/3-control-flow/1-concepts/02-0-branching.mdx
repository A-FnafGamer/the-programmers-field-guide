## Concept

There are two main ways of controlling the sequence of actions in a program. The first of these is called **branching**, or **selection**. Branching allows you to get the computer to take one of a number of paths based on the value of a *condition*.

<div class="caption"><span class="caption-figure-nbr">Figure x.y: </span>Branching commands the computer to take one of a number of possible paths</div><br/>

:::note

- Branching is a kind of **action**. You can command the computer to take of a number of paths.
- A branch has a **condition** that is evaluated, and based on the condition the computer takes one path.
- The branch is the act of choosing the path, when its command is performed the computer evaluates the condition and then moves to the instructions in the indicated path.
- Languages usually offer two kinds of branching statements:
  - [If Statement](#if-statement) to select between two paths based on a Boolean expression.
  - [Case Statement](#case-statement) to select a path based on an ordinal<sup>[1](#FootnoteOrdinalValues)</sup> value.
- The Branch will have one entry point, and one exit point. This feature allows you to combine statements together like building blocks. This idea comes from the principles of **Structured Programming**, where each component in the code should have a single entry and exit point.

<div id="FootnoteOrdinalValues" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup>Integers and Characters are ordinal values. Ordinal values have a defined sequence, so it is possible to say which value comes next in the sequence. Integers are Ordinal as you can say that the number after 1 is 2. Real numbers are not ordinal as you cannot say which value comes next in the sequence.</div>
