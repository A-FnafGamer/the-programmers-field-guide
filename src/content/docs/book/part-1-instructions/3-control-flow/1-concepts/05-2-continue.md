The continue statement is used to jump to the condition of the current loop. This is useful for skipping the processing of the current loop, but to allow the loop to continue for the next cycle.

:::note

- The continue statement is an **action**, allowing you to jump to the condition of the current loop. 
- The continue statement should be coded within a [Branching](../02-branching) statement that checks if the loop should skip processing of the current cycle.
