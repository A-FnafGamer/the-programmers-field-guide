The case statement is the second kind of branching statement. This allows you to create paths that execute based on matching a value from an expression. This allows one case statement to handle many alternative paths.

:::note

- The case statement is a kind of **action**. It allows you to command the computer to select a path based upon the value of an expression.
- Each path within the Case Statement has a value. When the computer executes the case statement the path values are used to determine which path will be taken. 
- In C and Pascal the Case Statement only works with Ordinal Values. This limits you to using Character or Integer values within the Case Statementâ€™s Expression.
- The Case Statement has one entry point, multiple paths, and then one exit point.
