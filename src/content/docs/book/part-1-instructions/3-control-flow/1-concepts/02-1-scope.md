Compound statements introduce a new programming concept called **scope** to our code. Scope refers to the lifetime and accessibility of variables within your code.

So far, variables have been accessible from where they are declared to the end of the program. This makes sense, as the variables are created within the program's instructions. So they live from when they are created until the program ends.
