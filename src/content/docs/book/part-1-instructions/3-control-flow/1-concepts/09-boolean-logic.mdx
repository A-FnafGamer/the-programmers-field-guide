Discover how to make and use of boolean logic for determining what is and what isn't true.

Control flow requires a means of determining which path to take. To achieve this, programming languages use something known as **Boolean Logic**, which allows us to work with values representing truth.

## Boolean values

A boolean value will be either **true** or **false**, so it can be used to worth with values that represent truth.

In C# there is a `bool` type that you can use if you want to create variables that store boolean values, but in many cases you can calculate these values within expressions.

## Comparison Operators

C# provides a number of boolean operators that you can use to calculate boolean values by comparing two expressions. The following table lists the different comparison operators.

Comparison  | Operator | Example | |
--|--|--|--|
Equality  | `==`  | `a == 10`  | Does a equal 10?
Greater Than  | `>`  | `b > a` | Is b larger than a?
Less Than | `<` | `a < b` | Is a less than b?
Greater Than or Equal To | `>=` | `age >= 18` | Is age greater than or equal to age?
Less Than or Equal To | `<=` | `age <= 10` | Is age less than or equal to age?
Not Equal To | `!=` | `day != 1` | Is day not equal to 1? (Is day anything other than one?)

The comparison operators can have expressions on either side of the operator. For example the expression `a + 5 < b * 2` asks, "Is `a + 5` less than `b * 2`?"

## Boolean Methods

It is also common for methods to calculate boolean values. In these cases you are asking the method to calculate if something is true or false.

For example, the following SplashKit method calls all return a boolean value (`bool` in C#).

Method Call  |  Is Asking
--|--
`SplashKit.KeyDown( KeyCode.TKey )`  |  Is the T key held down?
`SplashKit.KeyUp( KeyCode.LeftKey )`  |  Is the Left arrow key up?
`SplashKit.KeyTyped( KeyCode.EscapeKey )`  |  Did the user type (press and release) the Escape key?
`SplashKit.ButtonClicked( MouseButton.LeftButton )`  |  Was the Left mouse button clicked?
`img.PointCollision(x, y, ptX, ptY)`  |  Called on an `img` Bitmap object. If I draw the bitmap at `x, y`, would it collide with the point `ptX, ptY`?

## Boolean Operators

Boolean, or logical, operators work with boolean values. You can use these to change a boolean value, or to combine together multiple boolean values. The following table lists the different operators available in C#.

| Name  | Operator  |  Example | |
|--|---|--|--|
| And  | `&&`  |  `a == 10 && b == 20` | Does `a == 10` **and** `b == 20`? |
| Or  | `\|\|`  | `a <= 10 \|\| a <= 20` | Is `a <= 10` **or** `a >= 20` |
| Not | `!` | `! SplashKit.KeyDown( KeyCode.SpaceKey )` | Is `SplashKit.KeyDown( KeyCode.SpaceKey )` not true? (is it false - is the space key not held down) |


These operators can be used to check multiple conditions. For example, you could check if a mouse button was clicked **and** that the mouse was over a button or an image. You could check if a value is outside a range by seeing if it is less than the min value **or** larger than the max value. You could check if it is in range by asking, is it min than the low value **and** lower than the max value.

The following truth tables show what the result of these operators are given the supplied input values.

For **and** to be true, both of the input values must also be true.

and  | true  |  false
--|---|--
**true**  |  true |  false
**false**  | false  |  false

For **or** to be true, either or both of the input values must be true.

or  | true  |  false
--|---|--
**true**  |  true |  true
**false**  | true  |  false

The **not** operator will change something that is true to be false, and something that is false to be true.

not  | |
--|---
**true**  |  false
**false**  | true
