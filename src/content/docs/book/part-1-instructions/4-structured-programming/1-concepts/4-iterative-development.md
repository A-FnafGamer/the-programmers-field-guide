title: Iterative Development
---

The software development lifecycle describes the steps typically involved in building programs. These include:

1. Requirements Analysis
2. Software Design
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Deployment

Requirements analysis involves understanding what software needs to be built, resulting in a list of functional and quality requirements. This requires you to discuss the program with associated stakeholders, understanding what they require from the software, and how the software will be used.

Once you have the requirements, you can start to design your solution. This involves sketching out the plan for how the software will work. You need to think through the steps the computer will perform, and the data that it will need to meet the system's requirements.
