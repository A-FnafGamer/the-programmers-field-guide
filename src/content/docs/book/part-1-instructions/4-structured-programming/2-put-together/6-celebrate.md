Computers are unintelligent. So it is a great achievement when you get something working. So when do you get it going make sure to show it off.

At this point you want to understand how it achieves what it does, and be able to explain that to others. If you can achieve that at this point you are well on the way, and the next set of tools you will see will all just help make this easier for you.

If you are still struggling to see how it all works, then spending some more time asking questions, stepping through the code, and hand executing things will really help. The next set of tools look to help structure the way we put the program together, which builds on top of these ideas. So make sure you feel confident that you have these concepts mastered before you go on.
