## Writing the code for Guess that Number

**[Needs to be written from scratch]**

Flowcharts and Pseudocode communicate the same ideas. They describe the actions that need to be performed within your code. The following section contains a description of the syntax needed to code these control flow statements in the C# programming language.

Remember the basic process for reading Syntax Diagrams is to:
1. Find the page with the Syntax rule you are interested in knowing about
2. Have a quick look at the Syntax Diagram and the rules it contains. Read each rule, and get a basic feel for how it is going to come together for your program
3. Read the example to see one way of using the Rule. The Syntax Diagram can be sued to create any number of variations of the rule, the example gives you at least one way these rules can be coded.
4. Return to the diagram and make sure you can match each part of the example back to the rule that created it.
5. Look up any related rules that are not explained on this rule's page
