title: Designing Solutions

Learning to build solutions takes practice. The main this is not to get too overwhelmed with everything. One of the key strategies to overcoming this is that of breaking problems down into parts. This is referred to as **problem decomposition**, and is a key strategy to dealing with the complexities of software development.

Computer software is complicated, involving many parts that are all working together to achieve desired results. Utilisation of **decomposition** is critical to helping us work effectively.

As you get started with this, make sure to approach things iteratively. Do not try to do too much in any step. Get something simple working, then add a little, get it working, and repeat this until you achieve your goals.

Things won't always go to plan, but working in small iterations will help. You will encounter two kinds of issues: syntax issues and logic issues.

Syntax errors are the easiest, but probably more frequent, to deal with. When you get stuck with syntax errors, look back over the examples and sample programs to help you. Remember the computer is unintelligent, so you have to strictly adhere to the rules of the language. Always start with the first error message, and work through them in order - rebuilding the program after each error is addressed.

The good thing about syntax errors is that you know when they are solved. If the compiler is about to build your program, then you have the code right.

The more challenging problems are the logic errors. These are the errors where you have a valid program, but it does not work as you intended. When you get stuck with logic errors you need to think.

:::tip

Make sure you have at least a pseudocode plan you are aiming to implement. This could be in your head, or written down. If you find yourself randomly changing the code to try to get it working, then stop and think. Maybe you have not fully understood some concepts, or you are generally stuck. Get some help by talking someone through your program and how you are intending it to work.
