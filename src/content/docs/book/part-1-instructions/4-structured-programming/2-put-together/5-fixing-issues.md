Usually when you find the error, you will know how to fix it. Most times this will be a small fix, but sometimes you have to go back and rethink your plan.

Once you fix the error, then you need to re-run the program and test it again. Try to recreate the example where the error occurred so that you can see that it now works as expected.

Finding the source of the issue will be most of the work. Once you find it, and have understood why it is an issue, you will be well on the way to solving it.

It would not be uncommon to have to spend several hours to find an issue in a large program, and then for the fix to be a chance of a single character. So don't worry if you feel like you spend more time finding the issue than fixing it - that is all part of the job.
