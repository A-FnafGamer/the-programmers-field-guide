title: Differences between languages

See some of the similarities and differences that exist between object oriented programming languages.

Learning to program can be challenging, so the thought of learning a second language may be daunting. However, once you have started to work with a second programming language you will start to see how similar programming languages are. Learning a second programming language is a lot less effort than learning the first. To help you get started let's have a look at some of the basics of the Python programming language.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, so it is possible to create both procedural and object oriented programs. This means that you can have methods (known as functions and procedures in the procedural paradigm) outside of classes. The following code demonstrates the use of Python in defining a simple version of the Light Simulator from earlier weeks. Read over the code and see if you can understand how it works.

```py
"""The Light Simulater program"""
from splashkit import *

class LightBulb(object):
    """Creates a light bulb."""

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.__x = x
        self.__y = y
        self.__is_on = False

    def toggle_power(self):
        """Toggles the power of the lightbulb"""
        self.__is_on = not self.__is_on

    def draw(self):
        """Draws the lightbulb"""
        draw_bitmap(self.image, self.x, self.y)

    @property
    def image(self):
        return bitmap_named("On" if self.__is_on else "Off")

    @property
    def x(self):
        return self.__x

    @property
    def y(self):
        return self.__y

def run():
    load_resources()
    window = open_window("LightSimulator", 800, 600)
    light_bulb = LightBulb(20, 30)

    while not window_close_requested(window):
        process_events()

        if key_typed(KeyCode.space_key):
            light_bulb.toggle_power()
            
        clear_screen(color_white())
        light_bulb.draw()
        refresh_screen()

    close_window(window)

def load_resources():
    load_bitmap("On", "medium-on-light.png")
    load_bitmap("Off", "medium-off-light.png")

run()
```

See how we can declare methods outside of the class, with `load_resources` and `run`. These global methods are similar to `static` methods in C#, but as they are defined outside of a class there is no need for any special syntax.

Notice the use of a `while` loop and an `if` statement, both of which work exactly as their C# counterparts. There are no braces (`{...}`) as Python uses nesting as a means of determining blocks of code. This was a convention in C#, and in most languages, but is actually part of the syntax in Python.

There is no need for a specific `Main` method in Python, instead the code executes when loaded. Notice that we call `run()` at the end of the file which will mean that the `run()` procedure will execute when this is loaded.

Python also uses dynamic typing, so there is no need to declare variables and specify their types. Instead you can just store a value in a new variable to both create the variable and set its type. In the `__init__` method, notice that the code assigns the values from the parameters to `__x` and `__y` values within the `self` parameter. This creates two fields within the object, and initialises them to the values passed in by the caller.

The `self` parameter is an peculiarity of Python. This parameter represents the current object in Python methods. The `__init__` method is the equivalent of a constructor, which is being called where the light bulb object is created (`light_bulb = LightBulb(20, 30)`). Notice that we can then call the `toggle_power` and `draw` methods on this object, just like we did in C#. The object then becomes `self` within these methods when they run, much like it becomes `this` in C#.

Read over the rest of the code and you should be able to see how each of the parts relates to a C# equivalent.

Review the code and think about how this would have been created. Do you think that the process to create this is much different to the process of creating the same program in C#? What do you think the greatest challenging of learning a new language will be?
