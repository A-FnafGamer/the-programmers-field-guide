title: .NET Library

Explore the structure of the .NET class library, and how start to think about how you can use this to start building more sophisticated programs.

Now that you have learnt all of the basic structures in object oriented programming languages you can start to use this knowledge to make use of the libraries and frameworks that ship with each programming language.

C# is part of Microsoft's .NET framework, which means that you can use classes from the .NET libraries to help build out the functionality of your programs. The .NET framework includes classes you can use to build programs that will run across Microsoft's various operating systems (Windows 10, XBox, HoloLens, Surface, etc), as well as frameworks to generate dynamic web content using ASP.NET. 

Microsoft's [Overview of the .NET Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zw4w595w(v=vs.110).aspx) provides a brief description of the structure of .NET. The framework is large, as you can see if you visit the [.NET Framework Class Library](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt472912.aspx) documentation, but you will now have the knowledge needed to understand the programming terminology used to describe how these classes work. If you read down the page in the overview, it lists the different kinds of programs you can create with .NET. This includes [Console (or terminal) Application](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f492ca1w(v=vs.110).aspx), [Windows Forms](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd30h2yb(v=vs.110).aspx), and others. There are also classes that you can use to interact with databases using [ADO.NET](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h43ks021(v=vs.110).aspx), as well as classes for working with files, communicating over networks, and many other tasks.

If you take a look at the [Overview of Windows Forms](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8bxxy49h(v=vs.110).aspx), you will see that this centres around the `Form` class, which contains a number of `Control` objects. This pattern is similar to the shape drawing program we created, in this case the different controls can be buttons, text boxes, labels, lists, or other standard windows controls. By understanding inheritance and polymorphism you can understand how these classes can work together to make a graphical application.

Controls also need to raise events, which use **delegates** to allow you to register methods you want called when the event occurs. This pattern is used to handle a variety of different events, from mouse clicks, to key strokes, mouse movement, and so on. Understanding how delegates work, and thinking about the button we created, will mean you can understand how these event mechanisms work within these classes. Other, advanced features like [linq](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308959.aspx) make use of lambdas to allow you to integrate functional programming aspects into your C# programs.

Each of these parts of the framework will take time to learn, but the key thing to know at this point is that you are fully equiped to start using and understanding these, and other, professional libraries. Learning to use the libraries is then just a case of finding appropriate resources (books or websites) that will help you get up to speed

Read more about the [.NET framework](https://www.microsoft.com/net/framework), then reflect on what you have discovered and think about which of these libraries you are most interested in exploring further.
