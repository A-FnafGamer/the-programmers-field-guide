## Overview

So far data has been limited by the constraints of the Stack. With the stack, the compiler must know how much space to allocate to each variable ahead of time. This means you are limited to working with a fixed number of values, whether those values are stored in a number of variables or stored in an array. This constraint is not a problem for small programs, but most programs will require the flexibility to work with a variable number of data elements.

This chapter introduces the tools needed to dynamically allocate additional memory for your program to use. With these tools you will be able to dynamically allocate additional space for your program to use as you need it. As memory is finite you will also see how you can release this memory back to the computer when you no longer require it.

When you have understood the material in this chapter you will be able to dynamically allocate memory for your program, increasing and decreasing the number of values that you are storing.
