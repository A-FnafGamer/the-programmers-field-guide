title: C Pointer Operators
---

C provides a number of pointer operators that allow you to get and use pointers.

<br/>
<a id="TableCpointerOperators"></a>


  | Name | Operator | Example | Description |
  ------ | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
  | Address Of| `&` | `&x` | Gets a pointer to the variable/field etc. |
  | Dereference | `*` | `*ptr` | Follow the pointer, and read the value it points to.| 
  | |               `->` | `ptr -> field_name` | Follow a pointer to a struct or union, and read a field value. | 
  | |               `[]` | `ptr[2]` | Allows you to access a pointer as if it were an array. |

You can get a pointer to a value using the ampersand operator (`&`). This operator lets you get the address of a variable, field, etc.

```csharp
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct 
{
        float x, y;
} point_2d;

int main()
{
    float my_x = 0.0;
    point_2d pt = { 1.0, 2.0 };
    float *f_ptr;
    point_2d *pt_ptr;

    f_ptr = &my_x;          // get pointer to my_x variable
    printf("%f\n", *f_ptr); // print the value pointer to by fptr

    f_ptr = &pt.x;
    printf("%f\n", *f_ptr);                 // print the value pointed to by fptr
    printf("%f,%f\n", f_ptr[0], f_ptr[1]);  // prints pt.x, pt.y (bad practice)

    pt_ptr = &pt;
    // follow pointer, and get x and y fields from what it points to...
    printf("%f,%f\n", pt_ptr->x, pt_ptr->y);
    printf("%f,%f\n", (*pt_ptr).x, (*pt_ptr).y);    // same as above
    return 0;
}


```

:::note

- The address of operator gets a pointer to the value in the expression that follows it.
- Dereference means '*follow the pointer, and read what it points to*'.
- Use the asterisks (`*`) to dereference the pointer and get the value it points to.
- You can use `->` to dereference a pointer to a structure value, and then to read one of the fields from within the structure.
- [Listing x.y](#ListingCcodePointerOperatorUsage) shows how you can get addresses of different variables, and how you can access the value pointed to using `*` and `->`.
