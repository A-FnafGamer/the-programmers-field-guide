[Table x.y](#TableStatisticsCalculator) contains a description of a small statistics programs. This program reads a number of values from the user, and then outputs some statistics calculated from these values. This program will make use of arrays to store the values entered, and then calculate the required statistics.

As before, the process to design and implement this program will follow a number of steps:

1. Understand the problem, and get some ideas on the tasks that need to be performed.
2. Choose the artefacts we will create and use
3. Design the control flow for the procedural<sup>[1](#FootnoteProceduralArtefacts)</sup> artefacts
4. Map these artefacts to code
5. Compile and run the program
