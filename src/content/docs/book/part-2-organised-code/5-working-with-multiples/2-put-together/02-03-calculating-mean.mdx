The mean of a list of values is the sum of those values divided by the number of values. In the case of the Statistics Calculator program there is already a `Sum` function, so the `Mean` function does not need to recalculate the sum, it can just call the `Sum` and use the result returned.

The length of the array can be calculated in Pascal using its `Length` function, where as C can use the `size` parameter to determine the number of elements in the array. In both cases the basic logic is the same, you use the `Sum` function to calculate the sum and then divide this by the number of elements in the array.
