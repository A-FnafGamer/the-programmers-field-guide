Calculating the largest value in the array, the maximum, will require the logic be adjusted to use the *for each* style. How do you calculate the largest value in a list of numbers? With a small list you are likely to just quickly scan it and see the largest value. Think about the tasks you need to perform, and maybe think about how you would do it for a very long list of numbers, one that spans across many pages.

The algorithm needed to find the maximum value in an array needs to perform an action *for each* element of the array. It needs to process each value in isolation, ignoring the other values from the list.

The key is similar to the logic from the `Sum` function. You need to keep a *running* maximum. This will store the *current* maximum from the array as you loop through *each element* of the array. Like the sum this value can be updated within the loop.

The Pseudocode for this is in [Listing x.y](#ListingMaximum). Notice that its basic layout if the same as the `Sum` function in [Listing x.y](../02-02-calculating-sum#ListingSum). It initialises the `max` value and then loops through the array performing an action for each value. In this case the action is to check if the *i<sup> th</sup>*  value of the array is larger than the running maximum in the `max` variable. When this is the case a new maximum has been found and is stored in the `max` variable.

One of the important differences between `Maximum` and `Sum` is the initialisation of the `max` value. In `Maximum` this cannot be initialised to 0 as this would fail to find the maximum if all values were negative. The maximum must be a value from the array, so it is initialised to the first value in the array. The for loop will then start looping from the *2<sup> nd</sup>*  element, as the *1<sup> st</sup>*  has already been processed.

Function: Maximum
-------------------------------
Returns:
    - Double: The sum of the value of the largest number from the data array
Parameters:
    1. data (array of Double) - the list of values to sum
    2. size (Integer) - the number of elements in data (C only)
Local variables:
    - i (Integer): index of the current element in the array
    - max (Double): current largest number
Steps
    1. max is assigned the value of the 0th element in the array
    2. For i, starts at 1 and loops to the highest index of data
    3.      if the i-th element is larger than max then
    4.          max is assigned the value of the i-th element of the array
    5. Return the result, max
