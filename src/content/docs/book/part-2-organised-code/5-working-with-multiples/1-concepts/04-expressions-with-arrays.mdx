title: Expressions (With Arrays)
---

Expressions allow you to read values from the elements of an array. To get an elements value you must supply the name of the array, and the index of the element you want to read.

:::note
- Expression is the **term** given to the code that calculates values within your Statements.
- You can read the values of elements of an array in an expression.
- The index values used to access the individual elements of an array are expressions themselves.
- Arrays are similar to variables in expressions, the expression reads the value from the element of the array.
- The index you supply determine which value is read.
:::

- In an array of structs, each element has the structs type. In [Figure x.y](#FigureRecordExpression) the `points` array is storing 3 `Point` values. This means the `points` is an expression to access the entire array, `points[2]` accesses the 3<sup>rd</sup> element and therefore has a `Point` type, and `points[2].x` accessed the `x` value of the 3<sup>rd</sup> element of the `points` array.

- Accessing a union value from an array is similar to accessing a struct value. In [Figure x.y](#FigureUnionExpression) you can access the array in its entirety using `data`, you can access the first `my_numbwer` value using `data[0]`, and you can access its text value using `data[0].txtVal`

- The `kinds` variable is an array of `Data Kind` values. The expression `kinds` is an array of `Data Kind` values and can be used anywhere the array would be accepted. `kinds[0]` is a `Data Kind` value and can be used anywhere a `Data Kind` value can be used.
