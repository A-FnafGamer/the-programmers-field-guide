title: Expressions (With Arrays)
---

Expressions allow you to read values from the elements of an array. To get an elements value you must supply the name of the array, and the index of the element you want to read.

:::note
- Expression is the **term** given to the code that calculates values within your Statements.
- You can read the values of elements of an array in an expression.
- The index values used to access the individual elements of an array are expressions themselves.
- Arrays are similar to variables in expressions, the expression reads the value from the element of the array.
- The index you supply determine which value is read.
