title: For Loop
---

As has been shown in previous chapters, Computers can only perform simple actions. They cannot perform an action on all of the elements in our arrays. For example, a computer cannot sum **all** of the values in an array. What you need to do is think of these tasks so that they can be performed **for *each*** value in the array. So the sum would become, for each of the numbers in the array, add the number to a running total. When this has been performed for each element in the array you have the sum of all of the elements.

The for loop is a **Pre-Test** Loop that repeats a block of code a number of times. You can think of it like a counting loop, with it counting from a start value to an end value. The for loop has a **control variable** that has the number of the current loop as its value.

:::note
- A for loop is an **action**, a kind of statement you can use to command the computer to perform an action.
- The key is to think about processing **each** element in an array, rather than thinking about *all* elements of an array.
- The for loop can then provide the infrastructure to repeat this code *for each* element in the array.
- The for loop is designed to work well with the array. The values in the *control variable* can be used to access the individual elements of the array.
- When processing the elements of an array you have it loop from the lowest index value (0) to the highest index value (n - 1).
