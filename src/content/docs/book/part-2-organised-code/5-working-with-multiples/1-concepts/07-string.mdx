:::note

- Boolean is an existing **artefact**, it is a **Type** that has been defined to represent text values.
- A string is an array of characters.
- Both C and Pascal have additional overhead in the string data. In C the overhead is used to store a single terminating character that indicates the end of the string, in Pascal this stores the number of characters

:::tip[Syntax]
C does not have a native String type, instead you use an array of characters. As a result, C has very limited support for string data. For details see **C String**.
