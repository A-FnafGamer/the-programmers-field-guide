### Store POS Input System

</div>

Over the next few activities, we're going to be creating a store's point of sale (POS) database to manage transactions and stock. Here we're going to set up the main input loop into separate functions and procedures, similar to what we did [earlier](./2-put-together/01-00-change-calculator) for our calculator.

To start, we're going to create the backbone of the application. This will handle printing "screens" to the terminal, getting the user's input, and changing "screens" based on that input. Make sure you're splitting up your code into functions!

Your program should:

- Print a list of "screens" and ask the user to choose one.
- Wait for user input, then change the "screen" based on what they chose.
- Have a "screen" which prompts the user to enter some product details and then outputs them. Product details should include:
  - Product Name
  - Product Brand
  - Product Category (e.g., Dairy, Bakery, Snack, Frozen, etc.)
  - Product Stock
- Print a basic welcome message to the terminal for all other "screens".

Validation:

- Ensure that the user's selection of screen matches one of the options.
- Ensure that the user inputs a valid amount of product stock -- it should not be negative or unreasonably high.

To make this program, you will need to implement the following functions and procedures:

| <div style='width:185px'>Name</div> | Parameters | Purpose | Returns |
|------|------------|---------|---------|
| `read_integer` | a string prompt | repeats printing a prompt to the terminal and asking the user for input until they enter a valid integer | the value the user entered converted to an integer |
| `read_integer_range` | a string prompt, minimum and maximum integers | repeats printing a prompt and reading an integer from the user until they enter a value within the specified range | the integer value the user entered |
| `print_menu` | | prints a list of menu options to the terminal | |
| `read_and_print_product` | | asks the user to enter the details of a product, then prints them to the terminal | |

### Dotifin Input System

Over the next several activities, we're going to be creating our own music application... Dotifin! This application will allow us to play music, browse artists, search for our favourite songs, and more! Here we're going to be setting up the main input loop into separate functions, similar to what we did for the earlier music activities.

As a start for our Dotifin application, we're going to have to start with the backbone of the application, which will handle printing "screens/functionality" to the terminal, handling user input for numbers, changing screens, as well as the simple music file playing from the earlier activities. Your program should ensure whatever input taken by the user is valid. Make sure you're splitting up your code into functions!

Your program should:

- Ask the user which "screen/functionality" they would like to choose
  - This should ask the user to input an int which is displayed next to a "screen/functionality"
- Wait for user input on each screen, then change the "screen/functionality" based on what option they choose
- Add a play song "screen" that asks the user for a music file's filename and what they would like to name it, then plays it
- Add a stop song "screen" which stops any music playing

Validation:

- Ensure that whatever user input your program takes matches the options
- Ensure any songs loaded are valid (hint: use music_valid(music musicToCheck))

Functions you should have:

- read_integer(string outputMessage, int min, int max) - Prints a message to prompt user for input, reads an integer from user input and ensures it is an integer, then returns it
- read_integer_range(string outputMessage, int inputInt) - Prints a message to prompt user for input, reads an integer from user input, ensures it is in an integer and in a specific range, then returns it
- process_integer_input(int inputInt) - Performs different operations, like changing "screens" based on the integer input
- print_menu() - Outputs menu information
- load_song() - Asks the User for a File name and name for their music, loads it, then returns it (You can take this from your earlier tasks and adapt it for C++!)
- play_song() - Takes in a song and plays it
- stop_song() - Stops any music from playing

### RPG Collision Tests

Over the next lot of activities, we're going to be creating some functionality for our very own Role Playing Game (RPG)! This game will allow us to walk around, interact with Non-Player Characters (NPCs), pick up and use items, and more! Here we're going to be setting up the main event and render loop, as well as create some more efficient collision tests.

As a start to our RPG Game, we're going to start with our event loop and render loop. Your program should first spawn (draw) a player character to the screen, as well as a NPC to the screen. After that, the player should be able to move their character around the screen with WASD, not allowing them to leave the edges of the screen. Lastly, perform a series of collision checks, starting with a very large circle around the player character, then smaller circle, then a precise collision. If the player ever collides with the NPC, stop drawing them for now. Make sure you're splitting up your code into functions!

Your program should:

- Draw the player character to the center of the screen (just a square for now!)
- Draw a NPC to the screen somewhere away from the character (just a triangle for now!)
- Allow the player to move their character around the screen with WASD
  - Don't let the character leave the edges of the screen
- Perform a series of collision checks:
  - First, see if anything is within a relatively large circle of the player
  - If that succeeds, then check a smaller circle that still fits the player inside comfortably
  - Finally, if that succeeds, check to see if something is actually colliding with our character
  - Don't Draw the NPC anymore for now if the player character ever collides with them
  
Functions you should have:

- render() - Performs the drawing of the characters and screen
- draw_player(int playerX, int playerY) - Draws the player character from their coordinates
- draw_NPC(int npcX, int npcY) - Draws the NPC from their coordinates
- collision_radius(float radius, int originX, int originY, int destinationX, int destinationY) - Checks to see if point (desintationX, destinationY) is in circle of size radius at (originX, originY)
- has_NPC_player_collided(int playerX, int playerY, int npcX, int npcY) - Checks three different collision tests and returns true if all three succeed
