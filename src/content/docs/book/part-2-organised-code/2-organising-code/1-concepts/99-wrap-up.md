In many ways a function is just like a [Method](../03-method), it has a name, can be called, can accept arguments (using [parameterss](../16-parameter), can have [local variables](../14-local-variable), and performs a number of instructions when it is called. Unlike a Method, however, Functions are used to calculate values. When the function you called ends it returns back to you with a value.
