title: Designing Control Flow
---
Having chosen the artefacts to build, the next step is to design the control flow that will enable these Functions and Procedures, and the program itself, to achieve their goals. Each has a responsibility that it must meet in order for the overall solution to work.

This section will go through designing the logic for the `Perform Guess` Function. It will cover the following points:

- Drawing control flow using a Flowchart
- Use Structured Programming Principles to guide the design of the flowchart
- The Structured Programming blocks used to build the logic
- Combining blocks for the Perform Guess
- Setting the result using an Expression
- The Pseudocode for `Perform Guess`
