Guess that Number is a relatively common game involving one player choosing a number, and the other trying to guess it. Each guess is followed by an indication of whether the guess was less than or larger than the target number. The game continues until the player guesses the target number.

The data for this program will be relatively simple. The code will need to keep track of the current **target number** which will be an integer. The player will be able to enter a **guess**, also an integer. These two numbers represent the data model for the game. It is a game that involves a *target number* and *guess*.

The actions within the program involve **playing the game**, and **performing a guess**. Playing the game is the process of performing guesses until the player finally guesses the target number. This version of the game will only allow the player to have seven guesses, so this will need data and a part of this code in the program. The process of performing a guess will involve getting the user's guess, and giving them feedback indicating if they guessed the target number, of if they were larger than, or less than the target.
