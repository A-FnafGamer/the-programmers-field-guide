title: Designing Guess that Number
---

[Table x.y](#TableGuessThatNumberDescription) contains a description of the next program we are going to design. This program plays a small guessing game called *Guess that Number*. In this game the computer will think of a target number between 1 and 100. The user then has 7 guesses to determine the target number's value. At each guess the computer outputs a message to indicate if the target number is greater than, less than, or equal to the user's guess.

| **Name** | *Guess that Number* |
| **Description** | A simple guessing game where the computer 'thinks' of a number between 1 and 100, and the user has seven guesses to guess it. With each guess the computer indicates if the number it is thinking of is less than, or greater than the user's guess. If the user runs out of guesses they are shown the answer, and that round ends. After each round the user has the option to play again, or to quit the program. |

As before, the process to design and implement this program will follow a number of steps:

1.  Understand the problem, and get some ideas on the tasks that need to
    be performed.
2.  Choose the artefacts we will create and use
3.  Design the control flow for the procedural<sup>[1](#FootnoteControlFlowElements)</sup> artefacts
4.  Map these artefacts to code
5.  Compile and run the program

The new step in this process will involve designing the flow of the instructions within the program, and the Functions and Procedures that need to be created. Previously each artefact had a sequential flow of
instructions, the introduction of the control flow statements has made it possible to add branches and loops to this sequence. The order of these actions needs to be considered for each sequence of instructions in your code.
