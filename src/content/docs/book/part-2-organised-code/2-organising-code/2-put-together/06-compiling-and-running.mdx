## Compiling and Running Guess that Number

Once you have completed the code for this program you need to compile and run it. As this uses random numbers you cannot generate standard test data in order to check the execution. Instead you should perform a number of executions and test the different paths through the program. The main condition you want to check are:

-  Test failing to get the number in seven guesses.
-  Test getting the number correct within seven guesses.
-  Check the output messages when your guess is less than the number (you can enter a guess below 0).
-  Check the output message when your guess is larger than the number (you can enter a guess larger than 100).
-  Check that the random sequence is different each time, if its not make sure you have seeded the random number generator.
