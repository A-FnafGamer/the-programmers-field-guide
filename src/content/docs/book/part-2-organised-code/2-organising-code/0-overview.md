title: Overview

This part of the journey should really help make this so much easier. With a few new tools, we can start to break down our code into smaller sections, meaning we do not have to keep so much logic in our heads all at once.

If we think back to the change calculator, there was a lot of logic going on, and we did not have a way to start to rearrange this so that we could focus on different, smaller, parts one at a time.

## Learning Goals

At the end of this chapter you will be able to:

- explain the use of functions, procedures, and parameters in helping organise your code
- create functions and procedures
- use parameters to accept arguments from callers
- return results to function calls
