## What is an object?

Classes are a powerful tool, but on their own they don't do much to help us create digital realities.
This is because a class is just a *description* of a entity.
We need to use that description as a blueprint to **construct** an **object**.

Figure X shows a sketch of the **object** concept.
Remember that a class describes a custom data type; an object is simply a **value** of that type.
As with any other value in a program, an object has a location in memory.
That memory is subdivided to make a space to store the value of each of the object's fields.
These fields and their values are the **state** of the object.

<!-- TODO: remake concept diagram properly -->

Another term for an object is an **instance** of a class.
This is because the process of constructing an object can also be called **instantiating** the object.
Each instance of a class is a self-contained entity.
What this means is that although we can create multiple objects from the same class, each object we create will have its own state.
For example, if we had a "Person" class with a field "name", every instance of "Person" would have its own location in memory and its own "name" variable within that memory.


<!--
* you can think of an object as a big blob of memory that contains values and functionality (it's not actually, but we can use this abstraction to help us think about it)
 -->

## Creating objects



## Using an object
<!--
* but if an object is just a big blob of data and methods, how do we actually use it?
* the code in an object doesn't run in sequence (just like procedural code with methods don't run in sequence) -- call forward to the "looking inside" section?
-->

## In C#

<!-- 
* syntax for creating a new instance of an object
* syntax for using a field, assuming it's public
* syntax for calling a method, assuming it's public
* syntax for using a property (read and write), assuming it's public and has both parts
 -->

## Example
<!-- 
* class from classes concept, creating and using it
