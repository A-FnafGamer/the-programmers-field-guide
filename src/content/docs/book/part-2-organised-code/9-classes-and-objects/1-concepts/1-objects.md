To come...

<!--
* a class is just a description of something in terms of what it knows and does
* an entity/object is when we use the class blueprint to create something in memory

## Objects are self-contained entities...

Each object created from a class blueprint is self-contained.
What this means is that although we can create multiple different objects of the same type, each object has its own set of variables.
For example, if we had a `Person` class with a field called `name`, every `Person` object would have its own `name` variable.

## ...except for when they're not

* static is different tho

* classes don't run in sequence (just like procedural code with methods don't run in sequence) -- call forward to the "looking inside" section?
