title: Introducing Code Organisation
---

Welcome to the Part 2 of this journey. In part 1 you will have explored programs as instructions, and explored the structured programming principles of organising code using **sequence**, **selection**, and **repetition**.

At the end of Part 1, the amount of code we were writing is starting to get to a size where it is too much to deal with. We need new tools to help us manage the complexity of our code and to help us structure the data within the program.

Part 2 focuses on programs as a way of organising our code. This will greatly help reduce the complexity of the code we need to write, and further empower you to break down the code in manageable chunks.

To do this, we are going to need to change language. The C# language is designed for object-oriented programming, which we will work up to in Part 3. For the moment, we need to see how code and data can be organised at a lower level. The knowledge and skills you learn here will help you understand how things work within the computer, and give you the tools that underlie the object-oriented programming style we will explore in Part 3.

This part will explore the following areas:

- [Starting C/C++](../1-starting-cpp/0-overview) will get you going with the C/C++ language. This will help you see similar the syntax you learn can be between languages. The main focus will be on using the language tools to build and run programs.
- [Structuring Code](../2-organising-code/0-overview) looks at how we can create our own method like building blocks within our code. These will help us break down problems so that we mostly deal with only a few lines within any one part of the code.
- [Structuring Data](../3-structuring-data/0-overview) then looks at how you can structure the data within your code. This will really help you start to bring the digital reality into your code, with the ability to create and work with your own data types.
- [Indirect Access](../4-indirect-access/0-overview) will give you some tools to help access data in more than one way. Allowing you to more efficiently access information throughout your program, and bringing in a whole range of new possibilities.
- [Working with Multiples](../5-working-with-multiples/0-overview) will help reveal how to move beyond the singular variable values we have been working with so far to start to access multiple values without needing lots of code.
- [Deep Dive on Memory](../6-deep-dive-memory/0-overview) explores how you can work more dynamically with data in your program, breaking free of the fixed size constraints that have limited what we could do up to this point.
- [Low Level Programming](../7-low-level-programming/0-overview) wraps up this part, with the start of the journey of looking into low level programming. This will give you a starter for really making use of C and C++, and basic language features we have avoided up to this point.

At the end of this part you will be able to build larger and more complex programs, and have a good understanding of how these different tools let you manage code and organise data. You will be ready to start to move to higher levels of abstraction in Part 3 which brings together data and functionality in different ways that can help you conceptually model the digital reality you are creating.
