title: C/C++ Conventions
---

C# has a consistent set of naming conventions, but with C/C++ there are many ways that things are coded. With SplashKit and the code in this guide, we will use the following conventions for the identifiers we create and use.

- snake_case for functions and procedures (the equivalent of C# methods)
- snake_case for variables
- UPPER_CASE for constants

For example, the C# `WriteLine` method will be `write_line` in C/C++. Similarly, the `appearAtTime` in C# would be `appear_at_time` in C/C++. Constants like `WINDOW_WIDTH` would be the same in C# and C/C++.
