title: Main function 
---

In C#, we were able to code the programs instructions directly within the program code. In C/C++, and many other languages, you organise code into groups as we will see in the [next chapter](../../../2-organising-code/0-overview).

When you start organising code in this way, you need to indicate where the program starts. The `main` function indicates the starting point for a C/C++ program. The code within the braces (`{ ... }`) is what runs when the program starts.

We will go into details on how this works in the next chapter.
