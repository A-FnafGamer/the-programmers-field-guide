In order to explore the ways we organise code, we are going to be switching programming languages. Part 2 will use the C/C++ language, so before we can add new concepts and ideas let's have a look at how to build C/C++ programs and how to code sequence and data, and control flow in this language.

## C/C++

C/C++ refers to two linked programming languages: C and C++. The C language was written to create the Unix operating system, and was named as a successor to the B programming language. C++ extended the features of C, and takes its name from the increment operator from the C language (++). In this guide, we will use the C++ compiler but stick mainly with C features.

As noted at the start of the guide, we will be using these languages to explore the concepts. We will avoid many of the unique language features that you are not likely to encounter in other languages.

## Focus

For this chapter, notice how the concepts remain the same but the syntax changes... though the syntax will not change much.

In Part 1, we were using the C# language which is based on the C syntax. You can consider C# to be something like C++ ++. If you draw the sets of ++ one on top of the other, it even looks like the # in C#.
