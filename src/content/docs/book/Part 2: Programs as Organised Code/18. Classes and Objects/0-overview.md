title: Overview

In [Chapter 11](<../../11-organising-code/0-overview/>) we learned how to organise the instructions in our code into named groups called **methods**. <!-- TODO: check wording in chap 11, could be using "functions and procedures" -->
Then, in [Chapter 12](<../../12-structuring-data/0-overview/>) we learned how we can use **custom data types** to organise the data in our programs.

In this chapter we will explore the power of **classes**.
Classes combine some of the tools we have already added to our kit, by enabling us to organise our code into entities which contain both methods and data.
This is a powerful tool, which opens up new and exciting capabilities for building digital realities.

* very different way of thinking about code - part 3 is all about how to think about designing programs using this tool, but for now let's just learn what the tool is and how it works
* scalable
* something about procedural vs. OO programming?
  * we've done procedural so far
  * OO gained popularity (look up some history?)
  * both paradigms are still used, and in many cases combined
  * everything you've learned still applies (control flow, sequence etc.)

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:
