The first two legs of our journey have taken us to two quite different sites: the first looking at digital realities, and the second at using the terminal and shell. In this next step, we will start to bring these together to see how we can use programming tools (through the terminal and shell) to build and run our own digital realities.

This final chapter of Part 0 shows you how to create a project, build and run a small program, and then watch the program running using a tool called the *debugger*. Once you can use these tools, you will be set to go ahead and start learning about the things you can create within these digital realities.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:

- Create a project using the dotnet tools, and describe what the project contains.
- Write and save the provided source code using Visual Studio Code.
- Build and run your program using the dotnet command line tools.
- Run your program in the debugger, and step through its actions.
- Add SplashKit to create graphical programs.

You will need to use the tools in this chapter for all other programs you build as you explore programming. Make sure you are confident with each as you move forward.
