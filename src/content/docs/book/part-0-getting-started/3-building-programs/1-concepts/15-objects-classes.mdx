title: Objects and classes
---

Object oriented programming is building software from interacting components (objects), with each object playing a role within the program. C# is a programming language designed to work with an **object-oriented** approach to software development. With object-oriented programming, **objects** are the main programming artefact we work with.

Consider a computer game where the player aims to escape an alien invasion. The program has one object playing the role of the player, and a number of objects playing the role of aliens. Within the program we can think of the objects as a player and a number of aliens.  

Each of the **objects know and can do things**. For example, the player would know their position on the screen. The player would be able to move, shoot fireballs, take damage, etc.

In C#, you do not write “objects” directly in the code.  Instead, you create **classes** that define object roles and use these to create the objects when the program runs.

Within the class you declare **fields** to _know things_ and **methods** to code how to _do things_. Objects created from the class will have these features and are known as 
**static** members of the class.

There is one special **static** method that you need to have in one class for your code to create a valid **program**. This is a **Main** method, which is the first thing that gets run when the program starts.

**Methods** are another kind of programming artefact. Each method exists on an object or class (if it is static) and describes **one task** that the object or class can perform. For example, the Player class would have a Move method that contains the instructions that are performed when the Player moves.

Each method has a name that identifies it, and contains a list of instructions that are run in **sequence** when the method is run.

Each instruction gets the computer to perform a set action. These instructions are known as **statements** in programming _terminology_, and must be one of the available C# statements. To get started we will use three statements: 

## Variable declaration

A **variable declaration** can be used to create a **variable**. This is a special programming artefact that is used to **remember** something for future use. 

## Assignment statement

What the variable remembers is defined by the **assignment statement**. This performs an action that stores a value in a variable. 

We can use **object creation** in conjunction with the assignment statement, so that we can create an object and then store a reference to that object in a variable for later use.

## Method call

This can be used to run method on objects or classes. This gets the object to run the instructions within the called method. 

Method calls may require you to pass some data to the method. These values can be calculated or entered directly within the code. This allows you to pass in values from variables as well as values that you type directly in the code. 

Calculated values are known as **expressions** in programming terminology. The computer always evaluates the expression and then uses the resulting value.

To put this all together you need to declare a class and create within the class a **main method**. In the main method you can provide a **sequence** of instructions which create objects, and use variables to remember them, and then ask the objects to perform actions for you using method calls. 

In the following steps we will use the SplashKit library to create Window, Bitmap, Sound Effect, and other objects. 

Object oriented programming is about working with objects that know and can do things. In C# these objects are created from classes, which define a blueprint from which objects are created.

## Your Task

Reflect on a program you have used today. What kinds of objects do you think that program would have and why? Let us know in the comments.
