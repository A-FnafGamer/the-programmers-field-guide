title: Submit Task
---

You are ready to submit ‘Hello World’ to [OnTrack](https://ontrack.deakin.edu.au) for feedback.

Once you have checked that you are happy with your code:

1. Login, and go back into Tasks 1.1P.  
2. Change the status of the task from _Working on It_ to **Ready for Feedback**  
3. Check what files you will need to upload. In this case it includes the program’s code, as well as a screenshot of your terminal.  
4. To get a screenshot, start by making sure you can see your terminal window.  
5. Grab a shot of your Terminal window.  
6. Switch back to [OnTrack](https://ontrack.deakin.edu.au) and upload the code and screenshot.  
7. Add a comment to your tutor, let them know if there is anything  you want them to focus on.  
8. Finally, upload…  

The files will be uploaded to the server, which will convert them into a single PDF file that can be included in your portfolio. Your tutor will review your file and give you feedback. In general, your tutor will update the status of your tasks to one of the following states:

- **Fix and Resubmit:** there are some things you need to change in order to meet the required standard. You can make these changes and resubmit it.
- **Discuss:** the task appears to meet the required standard, and the tutor wants to discuss the ideas behind the task with you to make sure you are ok for this to be marked as complete.  
- **Complete:** once you have discussed the task with your tutor, and you are both happy that you have achieved the required learning outcomes, the task is marked as complete. You can include this task in your portfolio with high confidence that it demonstrates what is required. 
- **Time Exceeded** or **Submissions Exceeded:** you have either missed the deadline or have had the task re-assessed more than 3 times. We cannot provide further feedback and you need to make sure the task is of the required standard to include in your portfolio. 
In effect, this will limit your result to at most the grade of the associated task. Missing a deadline for a Pass task will limit you to a pass grade. So please aim to work to the target dates.   

- **Redo:** this usually means that you have uploaded something entirely wrong, or you have missed the point of a task. This is similar to _Fix and Resubmit_, but your tutor would like you to start the task again. Check their comments to see what they suggest.  

:::note
**Please note:** it is your responsibility to ensure all tasks meet the required standard in your portfolio. Your tutor is there is help you. If they ask you to fix, or redo a task, they are helping you improve your work for the final assessment in your portfolio.

Congratulations! You are well on the way to completing tasks 1.1P. You should have feedback from your tutor within a week, but in the meantime… you can move on to the next task!
