title: Scene Drawing
---

This week you will create some windows and use SplashKit to make a drawing. When you are finished, please share what you have created. 

When you have finished the task, post your screenshot to the Discussion Board.

The picture you produce is not the most important aspect of this task. Your focus should be on understanding the core ideas - instruction sequence, methods, objects, and classes. But this is a great way to share your success.
