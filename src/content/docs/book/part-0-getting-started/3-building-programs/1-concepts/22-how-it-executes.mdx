title: How does this Execute?
---

Understanding how programs execute within the computer is essential if you want to work with software. 

When you understand how programs work you can use this knowledge to design new programs or to troubleshoot when you have issues with other peoplesâ€™ software. 

- Programs run in sequence
- Method run within the context of an object or class 
- When a method is called, the method runs to its end before the code continues to the next statement.
- Variables can be used to refer to object, but the variable is not the object itself 

Getting started with objects can be challenging. Here are some additional pointers to help you understand how all of this code fits together.

### Variables

A variable is used to store a value. It is a location in memory. Each variable has a type, a name, and an associated value.

The following is an example of a variable declaration:

```cs
Window myWindow;
```

Here you indicate the **type** and then the **name**. This creates a variable that can be used to store a reference to an object (or a value when we move on to the material in course 1 week 2)

The following are all examples of variable declarations:

```cs
Window gameWindow; // 1 variable
Window guess, test, blah; // 3 variables
Bitmap ship; // 1 variable
Font f; // 1 variable
Font gameFont; // 1 variable
SoundEffect boom, ping; // 2 variables
```

Note: Local variables and parameters should be **camelCase**. Fields are also variables, and we should start these with an underscore (`_PlayerBitmap` for example)

### Objects

An object is created from a class. The following is an example of how you can create an object:

```cs
new Window("Hello World", 300, 200);
```

This creates a new **Window** object. In this case the **constructor** of the Window class needs you to pass in the caption, width, and height of the Window.

It is the **new** operator here that tells us that this code creates an object... it creates a **new** Window object.

The following are all examples of object creation:

```cs
new Window("My Game", 100, 300);
new Window("Boo", 200, 200);
new Window("Space Invaders", 640, 480);

new SoundEffect("Boom", "boom.wav");
new SoundEffect("PlayerHit", "splat.wav");
new SoundEffect("...", "a_sound.ogg");

new Font("Score", "arial.ttf");
new Font("HUD", "Crazy.ttf");
```

In each case you use **new** together with the name of a type (class) of object you want to create.

### Objects and Variables

We want to remember the objects we created. So we can store a reference to these objects in variables. For example;

```cs
Window myWindow;
myWindow = new Window("Hello World", 800, 600);
```

The above code declares a variable, creates an object, and stores a reference to the object in the `myWindow` variable (using the **assignment statement**). You can use the assignment statement to store a reference to an object in a variable.

The following code creates two variables and two windows.

```cs
Window myWindow;
Window testWindow;
myWindow = new Window("Hello World", 800, 600);
testWindow = new Window("Space Invaders", 640, 480);
```

You can also have many variables referring to the same object. For example:

```cs
Window myWindow;
Window testWindow;
Window whoDoIKnow;
myWindow = new Window("Hello World", 800, 600);
testWindow = new Window("Space Invaders", 640, 480);

whoDoIKnow = myWindow;
```

In the above code, there are 3 Window variables and two window objects are created. We store the window with the title "Hello World" in `myWindow` and the window with the title "Space Invaders" in `testWindow`. We then copy the reference from `myWindow` into `whoDoIKnow`. This means that `whoDoIKnow` will refer to the window with the title "Hello World" -- so you can interact with that object via either the `myWindow` or the `whoDoIKnow` variable.

For example, the following code will clear and refresh the window with the title "Hello World".

```cs
Window myWindow;
Window testWindow;
Window whoDoIKnow;
myWindow = new Window("Hello World", 800, 600);
testWindow = new Window("Space Invaders", 640, 480);

whoDoIKnow = myWindow;

whoDoIKnow.Clear(Color.Blue);
whoDoIKnow.Refresh();
```

What will happen with the following code? Which window is Red, and which is Blue?

```cs
Window myWindow;
Window testWindow;
Window whoDoIKnow;
myWindow = new Window("Hello World", 800, 600);
testWindow = new Window("Space Invaders", 640, 480);

whoDoIKnow = myWindow;

whoDoIKnow.Clear(Color.Blue);
whoDoIKnow.Refresh();

whoDoIKnow = testWindow;

whoDoIKnow.Clear(Color.Red);
whoDoIKnow.Refresh();
```

### Classes

We look at classes more closely in Course 1, Week 2. A class is a template that defines what objects know and can do. We could create Window, SoundEffect, Bitmap, and Font objects because there are classes for these in SplashKit. 

One challenge with classes in C# is that at run time you can also ask the class to do things, like you can objects of that class. The things that a class can do are defined by the class's **static** members. This is how we can do things like `SplashKit.Delay`. SplashKit is a class and `Delay` is a **static method** on that class. This means at runtime you can ask the `SplashKit` class to run its `Delay` static method. You don't need an object of the SplashKit class, just the class itself.

However, most of the time classes are used to define the fields, methods, and properties of objects created from that class. So the Window class, for example, defines a `Clear` method that allows you to clear the window. It also has a `Refresh` method, as well a properties etc. You can only access these features on Window objects, not on the Window class. In these cases you use the class to create objects (using **new** as we saw above). You then interact with these objects via one of the variables that refers to that object. The previous example that cleared and refreshed the window show how this is done using the **dot** (`.`) operator.
