title: Making programs

You will work through the basic steps you need to follow to create a working program.

Programs provide instructions to drive the computer. Each program contains a **sequence** of instructions that run within the computer’s CPU. For example, a program may perform a sequence of actions:  

1. Open a window
2. Draw a form
3. Collect user input
4. Perform a calculation
5. Output answer

One of the main challenges is that the instructions must be in a language the computer “understands”- in its **machine code**. Computers are binary machines, so this code is a binary sequence (basically a number) with each instruction having a unique sequence/value.  

Machine code actions are simple, they can add and store a single value and write a value to memory. This means that a program will typically require hundreds of thousands or millions of these instructions. 

Programming in machine code is not very productive, or fun… so software developers have built tools that we can use to write instructions in **programming languages**. These tools turn the text into machine code for us, but we need to follow the *syntax* rules set out by these tools. 

The .NET framework uses a combination of tools to turn your code into machine code. The **compiler** is used to *build* your program into a file that contains *intermediate code*. This intermediate code is *run* by the .NET **runtime** when you execute the program. The runtime is an advanced **interpreter** which reads the intermediate code and turns it into machine code while the program runs.

Making a [C#](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Sharp_Programming/Foreword) program will involve the following steps:

1. Write the **source code** for the program in a text editor – we will use **Visual Studio Code**.
2. This code is saved into a **source code** file. It will have a ".cs" extension to indicate it is C# code.
3. This is turned into an intermediate code file (a .exe or .dll) using the C# compiler.
4. Now use the dotnet runtime to run your program. 

For this to work the code in your source code file needs to follow the rules of the programming language. 

Don’t worry if you make mistakes as this normal. Learning to understand the error messages will be part of the process, and we are here to help. 

Tools like *compilers* and *interpreters* allow us to write in text, but require us to follow the rules of the language. In a few steps, you will have used all of these tools to create and run your own program.
