title: Artefacts, Actions and Terminology
---

Another challenge with programming is that you are creating something you can’t see. There are things you can use to help navigate this issue. 

The machine code for a typical program contains millions of very small instructions. We need to organise these instructions in a way to help us think and work at a higher level. To achieve this, programming languages organise your code around different artefacts (i.e. things you can create). These artefacts are created and manipulated by the code you write. 

When learning to program you need to understand the different kinds of **artefacts** you can create, the different **actions** you can get the computer to perform, and the associated **terminology**.

Program code consists of:  

- Code that **declares** (i.e. creates) an artefact. 
- Instructions that command the computer to perform an **action**.
- Instructions for the compiler, to help it locate other artefacts.  
 
Remember that **artefacts** are things you create in your code. You need to be able to see them, their key features and usage. 

With **actions** you need to understand what the action does: What artefacts does it interact with? What does it do with the artefact? How does it affect how the program’s instructions run? 

Associated with this will be programming **terminology**. Understanding the meanings of the different terms will help you communicate with other developers, search the internet for solutions, and understand things like error messages. 

Learning to program involves understanding the things you can create in code (artefacts) the things you can get the computer to do (actions) and the associated terminology. 

## Your Task
Can you identify any things you think may be code (artefacts) or actions in the “Hello World” program?
