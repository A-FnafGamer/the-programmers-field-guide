title: Installing tools
---

A big challenge with learning to program is getting started.  You need to start using the ideas you are learning by writing your own programs. 

Our first task asks you to create a “Hello World” program. It is a simple program that outputs the message “Hello World.”

This program allows you to check you have everything in place and that your tools are working correctly.

To begin you will need to download and install several tools, including: 

- A  **Terminal**  into which you can type commands to get the computer to run programs for you.  
- An **Editor** to write your code in.  
- A **Compiler** to turn your code into a program that can be run.  
- **SKM**, the SplashKit Manager, which include a library of code resources and the tools you need to access these. 
- Tools to grab a screenshot of your program running.

## Your Task

Use the following links to watch the instructions you need to get started:  

- [Linux](http://www.splashkit.io/articles/installation/ubuntu/)
- [MacOS](http://www.splashkit.io/articles/installation/mac/)
- [Windows](http://www.splashkit.io/articles/installation/windows/)

Discuss your installation process. If you experience any problems, let us know on the Discussion Board.
