Learning to program is an empowering skill that will take time and effort to learn. This week you have explored the basics of getting started with C# and object oriented programming.

## Your Task

You can now work through week 1 tasks on [OnTrack](https://ontrack.deakin.edu.au). You should have these tasks submitted before the end of the week. This will enable us to give you feedback, ensure you have time to get the tasks signed off or resubmit the tasks if necessary.

The week 1 tasks start with "**1.**x". Locate this task in your Task List. 

Remember that working with an unintelligent computer can be challenging, but we are here to help. If you get stuck go to the discussion board.

For some help with syntax details, see this week's [syntax guide](../26-syntax-guide).

In the meantime, reflect on what you have covered so far and let us know what you think in the comments.
