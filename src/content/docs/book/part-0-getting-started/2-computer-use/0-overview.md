The first leg of our journey will introduce you to a new way of interacting with your computer. This will give you a whole range of new tools to play with, helping equip your toolbelt within new capabilities, and positioning you to be a powerful and productive computer user.

You will be familiar with the standard user experience of using a computer. Using a computer involves touching and swiping icons on a smart phone or tablet, or using a mouse and keyboard to interact with buttons and controls on windows drawn to a monitors. These elegant digital realities provide a convenient way to enable us to launch and use programs on our computers.

But wait! There is another world out there. One that underlies all of these elegant interfaces that you see. One that we will need to start exploring in order to gain access to the full set of capabilities for our programs.

Developing graphical programs require significant effort to build the interfaces, in addition to having it do something useful. This is great if you want to build a program for wide use, but is not always needed if you have skilled users. As a result, there are many tools that developers and computing professionals use that **do not** have graphical interfaces. Instead, these tools have simple command line interfaces where you interact with it by typing commands and responding to prompts at a terminal.

The fact these programs have simple text driven interfaces can be a challengage at the start, but this makes these programs much easier to automate and you can combine them in interesting ways to quickly and easily achieve a range of useful tasks.

In this chapter, you will learn to use the command line and learn about the environment within which all programs run. Understanding this will help you debug issues and error messages from running programs. It will help you get a picture on how these programs are connected with the operating system, and it will start you programming the computer at the command line level.

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:

- Access and interact with your computer via a terminal.
- Use command line programs to perform a range of computing tasks.
- Explain the operating environment of programs, the means of sending input to a program, and interacting with the output fron a program.
- Use pipes and redirection to move data between programs, and to files.

There are lots of new concepts and tools in this chapter. Don't worry if you cant remember them all initially. Read over this and try to see the bigger picture initially. Maybe create a cheat sheet of the commands to help you remember what you can do. Draw up a mind map of the concepts.

Remember to give yourself time. Gain a basic understanding on your first trip through, then come and visit again to dig deeper into what is presented here.
