Shell scripting is increadibly powerful. You can automate many processes, and combine together the wealth of useful unix utility programs to process data without writing custom programs. This chapter will have given you all of the tools and background details you need to really explore this new world.

For now though, we really only need a few commands. So don't worry if you are not yet confident in what you can do in the shell. The main things you need to be able to do are:

1. Navigate to a folder in the Terminal (`cd`). You will need to do this to build and run your programs.
2. List files (`ls`) and check their contents (`cat`). This can be useful to make sure you are in the right place in the shell, and to help moving around.

The following knowledge will help as you start to build programs:

* Understanding files and the file system will be important to help navigating around. You can drag files and folders in from your file explorer if you get stuck.
* Streams and standard input and standard output. Many of the small programs you create will use these to interact with the user in the terminal.
* Signals to kill a broken program (ctrl-c) . When you are writing and testing programs, they can go wrong and you need tools to stop them.

The rest of the tools from this chapter are things you can come back to and work on over time. 

At any level, you are now starting to program the computer. You can start give it commands to do things, and save these into scripts that can help automate tasks.

In the next chapter we will see how to build our own program. You will need to navigage through the terminal, and run a few additional programs in the process. Confidence with the basics in this chapter will mean you are set to make the next step.
