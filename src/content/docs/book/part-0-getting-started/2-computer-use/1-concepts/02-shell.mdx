title: The Shell
---

*What commands can I enter at the terminal?*

The **terminal** program provides a text environment, allowing text input and output much like the old physical terminals once did. A terminal on its own is not very helpful though. Something within the computer needs to receive the text you type into the terminal and respond to it. We call this program a **shell**.

### Shell?

*Why is this program called a shell?*

This comes from an analogy relating to nuts. In the real world, the shell of a nut is a thin wrapper around its kernel or core. In a computer, the shell is the command interpreter that gives you access to the core of the operating system. Continuing the analogy, the operating system is also known as a **kernel**, the same as the inside of a nut. The kernel provides tools which abstract away many of the lower-level details of interacting with the computer's hardware. All other programs *grow* out of the kernel, just like plants grow out of the kernel of a nut or seed.

**TODO:** `ADD IMAGE - application <--> kernel <--> CPU, Memory, etc... see wikipedia`

### Terminal and Shell

A shell program runs within a terminal program to interpret your commands and instruct the kernel to perform the actions you request. 
A shell program is very simple. It provides a text prompt at which you can enter commands. The shell reads the text you entered, and performs an action based on this text.
You can use the shell to perform operations like copying and deleting files, starting programs, and more.

There are several shell programs you can choose from, each of which has its advantages and disadvantages. The shell we are going to use for this journey will be **Z shell**, which is built into most modern Unix operating systems.

:::tip[Charlotte's tip]
Understanding the difference between the terminal and the shell can be challenging, especially as many people refer to them as the same thing.

The quick summary is that the **terminal** allows you to input commands and view output.
The **shell** has the actual *logic* to interpret and execute your commands.

### Accessing the Shell

Ok, enough talk. We need to get our hands dirty and start playing with the Terminal.

** TODO make sure this works **

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

  <TabItem label="Raspberry Pi">
    * If you dont have a multitool SD card, then you will need to setup an SD card first. Download the Multitool image, and use the [Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) software to install this on an SD card.
    * Get your miltitool SD card and plug that into your pi.
    * Connect your display to the hdmi port of your pi
    * Connect a keyboard
    * Plug your pi and display into power
    * Watch it start… this will start at the terminal!

  <TabItem label="Linux">
    Linux variants are all based on Unix, so you will have a terminal and shell built into your operating system.
    If you don't know how to access the terminal, you should be able to find it within your application launcher.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="macOS">
    The macOS operating system is based on Unix, so you will have a terminal and shell built into your operating system.
    To access the terminal, use Spotlight to search for “Terminal” and run the utility that it finds for you.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    Unix is the most prevalent operating system in the world, and offers an elegant and effective terminal and shell experience. If you are using a Windows machine, you won't have a terminal or shell by default.
    So, we need to install the Unix tools somehow.

    There are two ways you can do this: use a virtual machine, or use MSys2.
    The easiest way is to download the Multitool virtual machine image. You can then launch this within VirtualBox to get access to a virtual version of the multitool environment.
    
    A slightly more difficult option is to install MSys2, which emulates the Unix environment on top of your Windows operating system. To do this follow the steps in the [SplashKit installer](https://splashkit.io/articles/installation/windows/). The **Msys2 Shell** is then the equivalent of the terminal on the other operating systems. You can find the MSys Shell by searching for it in the Windows start menu or in the **MSys2** folder in **Program Files**.

**TODO ADD IMAGE(s) maybe above**

### Give it a try!

At this point, you should see a “prompt” within the terminal. This is the **shell** asking you to give it an instruction. You type commands, and press the Enter or Return key on your keyboard to get the shell to do what you have asked.

Try the following:

```sh
echo "Hello `whoami`"
```

This command should output a message that says “Hello” followed by your username.

If you are using the multitool setup, then plug in a speaker and give this a try:

```sh
espeak "Hello `whoami`, welcome to the command line!"
```

This should get your pi to speak to you.

:::caution[Make sure to use backticks]

For these commands to work, make sure you are using double quotes (") around the text and backticks (\`) not single quotes (') around the `whoami`. We will look at why soon.
