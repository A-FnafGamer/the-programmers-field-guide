## Streams

Operating systems, like all programs, need to create *digital realities* for us to work with. We have seen how this applied to saved data, with files and folders. When we look at the execution environments, there is another concept we need to connect with - that of the **data stream**.

Data streams, often just referred to as streams, come from a river / water-flow metaphore. A stream is a flow of data - either into or out of a program. You can picture this as the data *flowing* in order through the stream from a data source to a consumer.

### Input, Output, and Errors

When you run a program, the operating system gives it three different data **streams** - one for input to be read, and two for outputs.

- **Standard input** provides a data stream
