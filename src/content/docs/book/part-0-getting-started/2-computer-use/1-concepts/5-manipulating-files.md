title: Manipulating files
---

The terminal is also great at manipulating files. For this journey, we only need a few basics but with a little further exploration you will be able to automate a range of action. Once you know the commands, you will be able to quickly and easily copy, move, delete, and update files.

|**Action**               |**Command**  |**Description**|
|-------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Make a folder (directory)|`mkdir`      |Creates a new folder at the indicated path.|
|Update timestamps        |`touch`      |Update the details on when a file was accessed. Creates the file if it does not exist.|
|Copy File(s)             |`cp`         |Copies files from one folder location to another.|
|Move File(s)             |`mv`         |Moves files from one folder location to another.|
|Delete File(s)           |`rm`         |Removes files from the computer. There is no recycle bin with this, so take care!|
|Open a file to edit.     |`code`       |Launch Visual Studio Code to edit a file or folder.|

## Creating folders and files

To get started, lets see how to create and edit files and folders.

### Making a directory / folder (mkdir)

With [mkdir](https://man.cx/Mkdir), you will be able to quickly create folders on your computer using the command line. When you call `mkdir`, you pass it the names of the folders you want to create. For example, the following will create a new *Code* folder in the *Documents* director of you home folder, and then create a *HelloWorld* folder within the *Code* folder.

```sh
mkdir ~/Documents/Code

cd ~/Documents/Code
mkdir HelloWorld
cd ./HelloWorld
```

You can pass `mkdir` a number of folders to create, and there is a `-p` option to automate the creation of parent forders.

:::note
**Call** is the term we use to describe running a command. So we can describe `mkdir HelloWorld` as **calling mkdir**. When you *call* something, you pass along th

### Making a file (touch and cat)

When you want to quickly create an empty file, the [touch](https://man.cx/Touch) command can be useful. This can be used to create empty files, or to update the timestamps of an existing time (saying that it was just updated). Letâ€™s have a look at using this to create an empty file.

```sh
cd ~/Documents/Code/HelloWorld
touch Program.cs
ls -lha
# You should now see the new Program.cs file in the list!
```

You only need the `cd` command if you are not already in the *HelloWorld* folder. In this case, the call to touch creates a file called **Program.cs**. You can then see this when you list the files in the current folder.

The [cat](https://man.cx/Cat) command reads the contents of a number of files and prints them to the terminal. The name `cat` comes from con**cat**enate, as you can use this to concatenate (combine) multiple files. Calling `cat Program.cs` will output the contents of this file to the terminal - which in this case wont show anything as the file is empty.

### Editing a file (code)

*How can we add contents to the file?*

While you can use command line editors like [vi](https://man.cx/Vi), [vim](https://man.cx/Vim), [cat](https://man.cx/Nano), or [emacs](https://man.cx/Emacs), lets fire up the graphical code editor called [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). This is a free, flexible, cross platform editor that is designed to elagantly write and edit program code.

You can launch Visual Studio Code using the `code` command in the Terminal. The [Visual Studio Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line) describes how to use this in detail, including how to install this shortcut if you have built your own setup.

To open Visual Studio Code (vscode) you run the `code` command and you can pass it one argument to indicate the file or folder you want to open. For example, `code .` will open vscode and have it open the folder from the current working directory. Use `code Program.cs` to open vscode with the *Program.cs* file.

```sh
cd ~/Documents/Code/HelloWorld
touch Program.cs
code .
# launch vscode with the HelloWorld folder open
```

Open the current folder, and edit the file to appear as shown below. Save it using Ctrl-S (Cmd-S on macOS) or clicking File - Save.

```cs
using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;

WriteLine("Hello World!");

```

Check the contents of the file at the terminal using `cat Program.cs`.

## Copying, Moving, and Deleting Files

In addition to making and editing files, you can also use the terminal to copy, move, and delete files.

### Copy and Move (cp and mv)

You can also copy and move files using the [cp](https://man.cx/Cp) and [mv](https://man.cx/Mv) commands. You can pass these commands two arguments - the **source** file or folder to copy, and the **destination** path. For example, you can use `cp Program.cs Test.cs` to copy `Program.cs` to a new file named `Test.cs`. If the destination is a folder, the file will be copied into that directory. For example, `cp Program.cs ~/Documents/` will copy **Program.cs** to the **Documents** folder in your home directory.

The move (`mv`) command works in a similar way to copy. You pass it arguments for the source file and its new destination. The copy command will duplicate a file, where as the move command removes it from its original folder and moves it to a new location.

When you copy a folder, you need to pass the `cp` command the `-r` option to recursively copy the contents of that folder. This means that it will copy the folder, all files and folders within it - and the files and folders within these as well.

The `-f` can be used to **force** the copy or move to proceed even if there is another file already in the destination. This will then override the destination if it already exists.

:::note

When something is recursive, it means that the action is applied again for each element within the parent context. So recursively removing a folder means recursively removing all folders within that folder as well. This in turn means recursively removing all folders within those folders too, and so on.

The file system is a recursive structure. Folders can contain folders.

### Deleting a file (rm)

The [rm](https://man.cx/Rm) command is used to remove, delete, files and folders. This tasks an argumeant for the path, or paths, that you want removed. For folders you need to pass in the `-r` command to remove the folder and its contents. You can pass in the `-f` option to skip any prompts and force it to just remove the files you indicated.

You can use `rm Test.cs` to delete the **Test.cs** file we created earlier.

:::danger[Take care with rm]

Remember that you are working **directly** with the operating system here. When you remove a file, it is gone. There is no recycle bin from which to restore these deleted files.
