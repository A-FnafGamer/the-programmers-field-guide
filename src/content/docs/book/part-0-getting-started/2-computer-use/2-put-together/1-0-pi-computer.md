    Build your own Multi-tool!
---

Building programs really requires that you have access to a computer that you can play around with. To maximise your experience, we have designed things to work with a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com) single board computer.

![Image of the full Raspberry Pi multi-tool](./images/Pi-Computer/CompeteSetup.jpg)

Using the multi-tool will give you several advantages:

- You can play around with unix without risking your day-to-day computer (which you can switch to Linux once you are more confident)
- The Raspberry Pi include pins for **General Purpose Input / Output** (**GPIO**) though a [40-pin header](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#gpio-and-the-40-pin-header) on the board. We can use this to interact with electronics and see how we can control things in the real world using code.
- Playing with a Raspberry Pi is just more fun üòÅ.

*Where do you get one of these multi-tools?*

You don't. You *build it yourself*.

The next couple of pages will go over how to build and configure the multi-tool. You can then use this for the activities in this guide. We will first look at the hardware you need, and where you can get it, and then we can look at the software you need and how you can install that using the [Terminal](../../1-concepts/01-terminal) on your Pi.

Let's get going...

## Alternatives

Not sure if you want the hardware, but still want to set something like this up? There are some alternatives.

Rather than getting a new physical machine, you can download virtual machine software and follow the software setup to get it working in there.

## Hardware

There are many hardware and component choices you can make building your Raspberry Pi multi-tool. Our selection is a self-contained unit using off-the-shelf parts that can run off a battery. Depending on your needs, you may forgo some choices, like the battery or the display.

### Building your multi-tool

:::tip
Using your own SD card? Make sure you have installed Raspberry Pi OS on it. You can find the instructions in the [Set up my Raspberry Pi](/book/part-0-getting-started/2-computer-use/2-put-together/1-2-setup-pi/) section.
If we have provided you with an SD card, it will already have the OS installed.
::: 

Check you have all the components listed above.
![Picture of Raspberry Pi components laid out in their original packaging](./images/Pi-Computer/AllComponets.jpg)

Locate the Raspberry Pi and 3 piece heatsink kit. Remove the Pi from its packaging.
![Picture of Raspberry Pi and heatsink kit](./images/Pi-Computer/Pi_Heatsink.jpg)

Peal the backing off the heatsinks and stick them to the Pi. The largest heatsink goes on the CPU(SOC), the two smaller ones go on the RAM and USB chips.
![Picture showing the heatsinks installed on the Pi and Heat Sync Peeled](./images/Pi-Computer/PiHeatsinkPeelInstalled.jpg)

Find the case remove the screws and feet. You will need a screwdriver for this part.
![Picture of the Pi case and screws](./images/Pi-Computer/PiandCase.jpg)

:::Tip[Install the Pi in the case.]
This case is a bit fiddly to get the pi in correctly, but it doesn't require much force.

- Place the Pi in the case
- Align the network port with the opening.
- Apply a little pressure to the back of the USB ports, the headphone jack should slide into place.
- Push the board across so the USB-C power and Mini HDMI ports are seated correctly.
- All 4 Pi screws should line up with the holes in the case.

### Powering the Multi-tool

There are several configurations you can use to power the multi-tool.
![Image of the multi-tool with different power options](./images/Pi-Computer/PowerOptions.jpg)

#### Option A - Mains Power

The easiest way to power the multi-tool is to use the power supply that came with the Pi. Connect the USB-C end to the Pi and the other end to a power outlet.
:::tip
Fold the screen down to plug in the power supply.
:::
![Gif showing the power supply connected to the Pi](/gifs/pi-computer/PowerSupply.gif)

#### Option B - Battery Power

If you are on the go or want to use the multi-tool in a location without power, you can use a battery bank. Using the USB-C to USB-A cable, connect the USB-A end to the battery bank and the USB-C end to the Pi. The battery bank will turn on automatically.

![Gif showing the battery bank connected to the Pi](/gifs/pi-computer/PiBattery.gif)

:::note
For intense workloads you may need to connect the display directly to the battery bank rather than via the Pi.

This can be done eitehr with the supplied USB-C to USB-C cable or using the 20Cm USB-C to USB-A cable. (Note that will disable the touch functionality of the screen).

USB-C to USB-C cable

### Tidying up

Just to make things a bit neater use cable ties to secure the cables.
![Image of the multi-tool with cable ties](./images/Pi-Computer/CableTies.jpg)

### Complete Setup

You should now have a fully constructed Raspberry Pi multi-tool. To continue the setup process, see [Set up my Raspberry Pi](/book/part-0-getting-started/2-computer-use/2-put-together/1-2-setup-pi/) for instructions on how to install the operating system and configure the Pi.
