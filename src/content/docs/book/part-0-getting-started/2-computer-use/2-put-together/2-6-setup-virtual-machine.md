If you cannot get SplashKit working natively, you can use *Virtual Machine (VM) software* to create a local Linux (*Debian*) environment that you can use to code with SplashKit.

## 1. Download Virtual Machine Software

There are many VM software options available. We have provided some suggestions below, but you can use any VM software that supports hosting *Debian*.

### VirtualBox

*Cross-platform.*

[Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is an open-source, cross-platform virtualisation software package for use on Intel or AMD-based computers running Windows, macOS, Linux, or Oracle Solaris, and is free to download.

You can download it from the VirtualBox Downloads site [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

### VMware Workstation Player

*Windows and Linux only.*

[VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/au/products/workstation-player.html) is a virtualisation software package for use on x64 Windows or Linux computers, and is available for free for personal use.

You can download it from the VMware Downloads site [here](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/en/downloads/details?downloadGroup=WKST-PLAYER-1750&productId=1377&rPId=111473).

## 2. Configure VM

There are many VM software options available. We have provided some suggestions below, but you can use any VM software that supports hosting *Debian*.
