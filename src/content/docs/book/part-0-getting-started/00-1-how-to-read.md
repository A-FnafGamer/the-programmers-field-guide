## Seriously?

## Our Goals

- we want to get you doing stuff as soon as possible
  - no [tutorial hell](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/qrlx5m/what_exactly_is_tutorial_hell/)!

## Chapter Structure

- each chapter covers one topic
- each topic may relate to multiple concepts
- we introduce the concepts
  - what it is
  - how to think about it
  - when to use it
  - the syntax for C# of C++
  - examples
  - how it works underneath
  - activities
- then we show you how to use the concepts to do something
  - not just an example, but taking you through our **thinking** process when we use the concepts
- then we discuss how these concepts look in other languages
- then we suggest some activities to help you test your knowledge
- not every chapter/concept will have all of these sections, depending on what is appropriate
- tips
  - don't copy-paste the code -- writing it out helps solidify your understanding
  - take notes
  - try stuff! If you're wondering what a change in the code will do, try it out. You're not going to blow anything up.
  - ask for help

Enjoy the journey!
